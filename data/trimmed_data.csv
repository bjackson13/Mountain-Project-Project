Pull the roof at the weakness~ then the line should be easy to follow for the remainder as bolts are visible.   After you pull the first roof~ the next bolt is heady~ but safe. There are a couple more bolts like that up higher~ with the crux coming at the next bulge.,11 bolts~ 2 bolt anchor with a locking steel biner,1

It starts on the route Exqueeze Me and ends on Inyo Face. The pitches are all kept short because of serious rope drag in crossing aretes and traversing alcoves. Because Area 13 is a very popular crag and this route traverses pretty much every route on it~ it can only be recommended to be climbed midweek or with utmost consideration for other parties.   Pitch 1 - Starting on Exqueeze Me~ traverse right and up clipping the 2nd or 3rd bolts of the routes crossed. Aim for the point where the route Ugly~ Fat~ Mean~ Come to Mammoth~ Be a Queen transfers from the blocky face to the arete. Thin slab climbing (the technical crux) from this point leads up and right to the belay ledge halfway up Wild Will's Arete.   Pitch 2 - Stem and flake climbing leads straight up from the belay to a bolt. Traverse right from here around the arete and onto the face. Level traversing around the alcove leads to a couple exciting moves getting to a sloping ledge and the belay for Borrowing From Tradition.   Pitch 3 - Level traversing right~ moving up where harder~ leads to a long right slanting crack. Follow this crack to a large ledge. Belay from the ledge with a gear anchor.   Pitch 4 - Exciting but easy moves off the belay slightly down and right (harder for the follower) leads to easy face climbing trending up and to the right. Belay on a ledge with a horizontal crack just above it. This ledge is located about 5 feet above the anchors for Demasiado.

The climb consists almost entirely of face climbing on big knobs and features~ with occasional crack systems for pro. There are no bolts on Blind Man's Bluff~ which makes the route finding and protection the main challenges of the climb. The climb feels a bit like The Flakes on MCR~ but shorter and not quite as good.    About 20ft left of the start of Braille Book is an outside corner with a large system of detached flakes resting against the wall. Begin by scrambling up the flakes (mind the loose rock) to reach a point beneath and to the right of a prominent roof. Climb an offwidth crack to the right of the roof and then stem across to traverse left just a few feet above the lip. Follow a crack system angling up and left to reach a half-driven pin. Tie off the pin and make a couple 5.8 moves traversing left to gain another crack system. Climb up the left side of a sort of rotten flake to reach a stance with a horizontal crack for an anchor (2-3""). This is a long pitch and has potential for very bad rope drag if you place gear in the wrong places.    The second pitch begins with a steep flake above the anchor~ then follows a corner system (5.9). After the corner wander up the face (runout)~ aiming for another left facing corner and roof. Move past the roof and climb easy terrain to a ledge atop some pinnacles and chockstones.    Pitch three climbs up beneath the bulge~ then traverses left before finally pulling over. Climb the arete to the right of a roof. At this point there's probably several ways to finish. I continued up and left to a bolted anchor with mussy-hooks (I think part of Remain In Light)~ then climbed up and right through some sort of loose flakes. This takes you big ledges and a tree where you join up with Braille Book and every other route in the area.    Climb the final 5.4 pitch of Braille Book to finish.

Then~ one day I found a description on the internet of an awesome sounding route right up the middle.  With 2700 feet of 5.9ish climbing~ it sounded too good to be true.  Finally in 2009 we went out and did the route and it has become one of my favorite climbs in Yosemite.    Tom Harper had a great topo here: (deadlink)myweb.cableone.net/tomharper/FTTopo dot html   My Favorite Things topo    The pitches are almost all 55-60m long~ ending in two beefy bolt anchors~ and the ""official"" ratings are:    1: 5.5   2: 5.8   3: 5.8   4: 5.7   5: 5.7   6: 5.7   7: 5.8   8: 5.9   9: 5.9   10: 5.7   11: 5.10a   12: 5.9   13: 5.7   14: 5.8   15: 5.9    I think these ratings are slightly soft~ but considering the amount of climbing~ you need to be solid at the grade to make it happen in a day.    With a 6 mile cross country approach~ 2700 feet of climbing~ 1200 feet of 3rd to the top and 7 miles back to the car~ it is a burly~ rewarding day.",All anchors have two bolts.  Almost all the pitches require a 60m rope.  The first 10 pitches can be rapped without leaving any gear.

From the adjacent boulder~ grab the left-facing sidepull~ find a good right hand and  then immediately pull through an overhang to get onto Peeper's Rock. A left heel hook can help. From this opening move it's about 15 feet down to the ground/tide. Don't look down if the thought of that fall scares you.  The main face above the first bolt is much easier~ until an interesting move or two between the last bolt and the anchor. If you're stuck~ look to the right of the last bolt to find better hands.  The moves off the deck are the fun/hard part - rope or otherwise~ it's a little invigorating to step of a ledge and onto an overhang above a treacherous fall.  One can start this route from the sand up the cave below~ but this adds a V6 bouldering problem (that is very difficult to protect) before the main start of the climb.,"3 newish glue-in bolts to a two bolt anchor with a rap ring. This route previously had OLD bolts that were slowly rusting away.  A stick clip is strongly recommended to clip the first bolt before leading this climb~ or a person taller than 6'3"" might be able to reach it by hand. Without pre-clipping the first bolt this climb is rated R~ given that the start is the crux and sits above a nasty 15-foot fall to a rocky landing.

Turn your attention left toward the similar~ although less impressive and intimidating knife blade ridge which begins in the super clean Craig Luebben dihedral and climbs several traverses and head walls to a pointy summit adjacent to the summit of Estraillita.     This is a fantastic outing and an excellent first limestone ridge climb in the canyon~ although the danger factor for yourself~ and more so for the parties below you~ should not be under estimated. The ridge is LOOSE~ and a large percentage of your day will be spent tip-toeing on the rocks that make the least amount of noise. Luckily~ the rock quality improves on the head walls~ and protection may be found throughout if you are willing to search. Just be careful~ and you'll have a great time! It is recommended to belay short of the base of each headwall in case something does become dislodged~ although you may have to fight some drag before you find something you're willing to use as an anchor. Simul-climbing is not necessary or recommended given the relatively short length and loose factor~ making a fall on easy terrain much more probable. Pitch it out 6 or 7 times over the double-exposed ridge until you reach the cool summit and belay at the super-comfy anchor on Will the Wolf Survive. From here it is four easy raps to the ground. Finally~ be careful not to pass the anchor on the first rappel~ which is approximately 30 feet below the summit~ beneath the overhang. A 70m will NOT reach the next anchor if you attempt to pass this station.,Single rack of cams (to #3 C4) and nuts. C3 size cams are useful. Long slings and cordellette.

A mix of different styles and difficulties.  This could use some traffic. It was fairly dirty when we climbed it~ though I imagine we were one of the first parties of the season. Plenty of pine needles and detritus caught in the cracks~ so take a nut tool as you climb.  P1: Cardhu Crack. You'll want to climb past the Cardhu anchors up to a ledge with rap rings. (5.8~ 45m)  P2: Climb up and right~ then traverse left along an easy hand crack on a ramp. Tree anchor. (5.6~ 15m)  P3: Climb right up a diagonal finger crack. The FAist describes this as a hand crack~ but you'd need pretty small hands for that to be accurate. Balancy and tough - will get easier when it cleans up with more traffic~ but will get harder again when the stumps eventually fall out. When clean~ this will be a very nice line. Bolt anchor~ belay in a hole. (5.10-~ 25m)  P4: The crux pitch is a beautiful and sustained line with tough~ engaging climbing. Traverse right~ clip a bolt~ chimney up through easier ground on larger gear. Clip two more bolts as you begin tackling the main feature: a thin seam in a little mini-dihedral (like two inches of left-facing corner) . Looks improbable for the grade as the seam is almost slammed shut~ but eventually the crack does open up slightly to take some small gear (yellow C3s to purple C3s). After your first piece of gear~ tips locks and eventually a finger lock or two begin to reveal themselves as the angle eases up. The crack peters out at the top~ so slab climb past 2 more bolts at a mid-10 grade. This pitch is very balancy and technical in nature. I'd read that you could easily aid through the thin section~ but I don't know - you probably could aid through it with enough RPs~ but this isn't a french-free-through-a-few-moves sort of pitch. Bolt anchor. (5.11-~ 40m)  P5: Climb a short~ steep and juggy right-leaning crack to a tree above the belay. Slab and a cool dyke traverse up to the bolt-anchors. 2 bolts~ and few cracks for gear every now and then. (5.9 - 35m)  P6: Walk into the forest~ then climb a fun~ long and easy pitch. Starts off sporty~ with many jugs and foot holds and lots of different gear options. As you climb higher~ the pitch becomes lower angle and slabbier in nature. Near a bolt there is a 5.8 slab move. I think there was 2 bolts on this pitch~ but there may have been 3. Bolt anchor. (5.8 - 40m).  To descend~ traverse left~ then right up a ramp.

P4: 5.9~ 10 bolts. Arguably the best rock of this climb. Pass some trees (right or left doesn't matter) to a corner slab.

It is a fun 9-pitch rock climb~ but requires a long snow slog to reach and is best done early in the season before the snow melts. Crampons and ice axes are required for the approach. Most of the climbing is 5.7~ but there are a couple of short 5.9 sections that can be avoided. A very full day out~ especially if descending west into Nesakwatch Creek and then returning to a vehicle parked in Centre Creek,"A light rack from nuts to 3"" cams is sufficient. Bring a 4"" or 5"" cam or big balls if climbing the offwidth summit block on South Nesakwatch.",1

You are guessing correctly that since it was done in 1970 it is sparsely bolted.    P1. Start same as Diedre and Rainbow~ where you pass the horizontal crack  Over the Rainbow goes straight up the greasy slab~ Sparrow goes a bit more to the right and follows the path of least resistance up ramp like right traverse heading for a lonely bolt~ clip and head for a small tree about level with the bolted belay of Rainbow on a faint horizontal dyke.    P2. About 40-50' above belay head left toward small trees( if you go up slab it is a run-out 10b variation) cross several overlaps angle back right toward big tree island and left facing corner.    P3. Either go straight up using water pockets~ or descend corner( original route) maybe 20' till you can go up obvious crack which peters out to a tricky slippery slab move up to big tree covered ledge.    P4. It can be confusing here which bolted line to follow. If you took the original route below it is the first line of bolts you come to going up the ledge to your left~ but maybe hard to spot bolts. The 2nd bolt line is the Delicious Dimples ( 10c) with more newer bolts. If you go all the way to your left you will hit the Over the Rainbow bolts.    P5. Wander up slab passing 2 bolts in like 100'~ going back and forth following path of least resistance till you see some crescent cracks but belay below on bolt and gear.    P6. Traverse left till you come to a good crack on right facing corner passing the Dimples route~ if you find yourself going up a steep slab you may be on Dimples( 10c). Go up this crack~ as it peters out go out onto slab on the left~ go up slab till you can belay on bolts below a left facing corner. McLane calls this pitch 10a~ Bourdon calls it 5.8~ I guess I would say it is 5.9.    P7. Follow corner up and go right out onto white slab ~ comes out near base of Boomstick crack.,"standard rack to 2"".Lots of slings even for bolts to help with wandering nature of the route.",21

Fully bolted belays and easy to rappel~ this is a nice sustained adventure up the east face of snow patch. It needs more gardening/scrubbing to reach its full potential~ and for a party that has the time fully excavating the cracks on the upper pitches and scrubbing off some of the lichen could make this as clean as Sunshine Crack! Full story of the first ascent and good beta found here: alpinestyle.ca/locations/bu….    P1 and P2: Start off the snow at the base of the wall on the left side of the obvious scoop in the rock scar. Climb up hand cracks (5.10-)~ cross the scoop (possible gear belay) then continue up the slabby but thinner corner (5.10+) to a two bolt anchor. This can be climbed in 1 pitch with a 70m (60m may work early season). Difficulty and length dependent on the amount of snow at the base.    P3 5.10+~ 30m: Climb the corner above and pull through a small overhang. Step left and up a shallow left facing corner~ until an easy ramp leads to flakes back right. Hand traverse these until you reach a two bolt belay.    P4 5.11+~ 35m: Great long pitch with three distinct crux sections. Pull through a thin section of tips down low that changes into a stem corner~ at the top of this corner move left clipping a bolt and pulling face moves onto the arete out left~ then cut back right into the corner. A few very thin stemming/ chimney moves (small gear) bring you up to another two bolt anchor.    P5 5.10+~ 50m: This is what you (maybe) brought the #5 for. Climb the steep fist crack off the belay and then layback over the bulge with the wide pod. Once you are established above this bulge~ look up above you for the bolt~ clip it and climb up and left into the right leaning corner above with a nice handcrack. Follow this easier climbing up and right until you reach the big ledge~ then traverse this up and left to a two bolt anchor with rings~ beneath a rightward trending groove.    These first five pitches are shared with Welcome to the Machine (a route that should definitely be added by someone who has climbed it). The Welcome to the Machine anchors are just to the left beneath the obvious flake.    P6~ 5.10+~ 30m: climb up into the groove~ clip two knifeblades and then face climb up to a two bolt anchor.    P7~ 5.11+~ 35m: Climb the finger crack~ traversing left and then back right into the main crack. Get some gear at the roof and then pull it. Mostly 5.10 fingers other than the roof pull. Anchor to the left on the slab above.    P8 5.11a~ 30m: Climb up and clip the bolt~ then traverse the slab to the right~ until reaching the base of the left leaning~ left facing corner. Head up this (micro cams and rps) until reaching two pins. Climb up into the main corner (another pin and 2 bolts followed by gear) and continue up to a bolted belay.    P9 5.10~ 55m Look up and right to the steeper~ left facing wall with a number of good looking cracks~ you are headed to the base of this. Mostly easy climbing with a short finger crack crux. Climb up the corner until just below the grassy ledge. Step right and traverse up on ledgy terrain until reaching a two bolt anchor. This is a nice bivy ledge for those who might want more time to do the route.    P10 5.9~ 20m: Climb up the best of the cracks~ belay station on the left but easy to link with the next pitch.    P11 5.11a~ 30m: Climb the right crack on good hands until it slims down to a thin finish into the alcove and a bolted belay.    P12 5.10+~ 35m: Climb up the crack on the left for 5m and then make a reachy moves with some face features to the crack on the right that parallels the arete. Follow this crack up over the lip to a bolted belay. This pitch might feel harder and could use a good scrubbing.    P13 5.9~ 30m~ Climb the chimney (easy but runout) to the top of the pinnacle. Can link this with P12 with a 70m.    P14 5.11c~ 30m: Pull bouldery moves in the thin left slanting crack off the belay~ passing 3 bolts. The crack then eases in difficulty and takes you up to a nice belay ledge.    P15 5.11~ 30m: This is the pitch that made me want to do this climb. Follow a fist crack up the left side of the pillar~ then look up in awe at the splitter thin hands crack through the headwall above. Rest up then punch it up thin jams. You could place 3x #0.75 or #1 camalots on this pitch~ but for the strong crack climber a double rack from #0.5 to #1 would be adequate.    P16 5.10~ continue up the crack as the angle kicks back and it gradually widens. Step right around the bulge and continue up a groove to a bolted belay.    You could scramble up to the summit (4th class?) or just start rapping the route. 2x 60m required to rap. Not all bolted anchors have rings/quicklinks so pay attention on the way up to figure out which to skip. From the top of P4 a 60m rap will take you to the top of P2~ then one more rap back to the snow (note that this won't be where you started~ so think about where to leave the packs~ we threw ours down onto the glacier to make them easier to get back to).,Double rack from #0 C3 to #3 Camalot~ + 1x #00 C3~ Set of nuts and RPs and an extra 0.3 tips piece.    Optional: #4 (may help protect P15 fist crack~ placeable but not particularly useful on any other pitch) #5 (may help protect P5 pod moves~ can be left at P5 anchor) and an extra 0.75 or #1 for the thin hands splitter~ maybe an extra 0.4 for the fingers sections. We could have done without all of these pieces but neither of us fell on lead.,8

This well-protected route features wild and varied climbing with exciting positions. It was first climbed as a winter adventure and upon reaching the top it was clear this line needed to be cleaned for its free climbing potential.  Pitch 1 (5.11d~ 30m): Clip a bolt and climb right to gain a partially bolted left-facing offwidth corner to a ledge. Make slabby moves up and left to a thin crack in a shallow corner. At the top of the corner~ step right and face climb to a bolted belay on a ledge.  Pitch 2 (5.11b~ 35m): Climb the double corners above the belay and move right to gain the major left-facing corner system. Near its top~ climb right under a small roof to an overhanging finger and hand crack. Bolted belay at a tree stump on the corner above. Burly and exposed.  Pitch 3 (5.11b~ 25m): Continue up the corner through a roof (bolt). Delicate face climbing and stemming past three bolts leads to a steep crack that climbs out of the huge roof that looms above to a bolted belay at a stance.  Pitch 4 (5.9~ 30m): Climb the offwidth to its top and move left to climb the left leaning gaping crack (fixed piton). Bolted belay. Those uncomfortable with wide climbing may find a second 6” cam useful.  Pitch 5 (5.10c~ 15m): Climb a narrowing finger crack in a clean left facing corner.,Doubles to 3”~ singles 4”-6”~ small nuts.    Well protected and cruxes can be easily aided.,5

Mostly done only up to the middle anchor to tick off that classic~ juicy 12a~ which puts it at the forefront of many endless grade debates~ it is nevertheless a very interesting climb with varied moves up to a unique and awkward crux sequence.    The start is easy enough~ up to a balancy section in the dihedral~ to a rock over on a slab~ up to a good rest at the base of a little overhung arete/bulge. The sequence up this feature is the crux~ and has been the scene of many failed redpoint attempts. A hard clip and a tricky sequence up the arete might keep your ego in check for a few tries too many if you underestimate this climb.    The second pitch is a classic and varied face climb~ taking full advantage of the wall by zig-zagging through it up to an exposed finish.    The original line has two excellent variants~ both climbing up and left from the rest below the bulge (instead of right and up the arete):    a) 4x4 (12a)~ which climbs slightly up and left past a small roof then joins the original line at the first anchor;    b) Go-Kart (12b)~ which branches out further left to tackle the upper roof and joins the second pitch directly without the pit-stop at the middle anchor.     BMW is the sleek curvy~ proud line that the rock seems to dictate~ 4x4 is the route taken through seemingly rougher terrain~ and Go-Kart will have you make obnoxious little engine noises as you wail time and again through its runouts and spanky cruxes.

The only thing I can think of that comes close is Whores of Balitimore.  Remarkably~ both can be found on the same album: Rogue's Gallery~ a collection of Pirate Ballads~ Sea Songs~ and Chanteys.    This climb actually has good climbing down low and up high.  There is also plenty of solid rock for gear- too bad you have to focus on staying on that and dodging choss.  Otherwise it would be a better climb.    Access the ledge from the corner to approach for The Side Wall~ Practice Climb 101~ and Rhombohedral~ move left 10+ meters to below a system of dirty-looking parallel cracks in chunky rock that go perhaps 15m to a tree.  Start up the left-most of these with surprisingly good holds and protection (crux) and work progressively to the right to avoid bad rock and the looming tree above.    Clip a sling to the anchors on the tree and look up and right to a tree at 110' off of the ground.  Climb up mixed cracks and face trending generally rightward to reach that tree and the fixed raps slings on it.    Per Dave Holliday: the second pitch of this route goes up the right-facing corner just to the left. The top of the second pitch ends at another good ledge.     Rap ~100' to the ground.  If you have a short 60m~ watch out at the end.    Per Dave Holliday: after 2 pitches~ one could rappel off trees (70m rope useful to get to the ground from the tree atop the first pitch)~ but given the amount of loose rock in this area~ consider traversing climber's right to the Long John Wall/Sooberb descent route.,A standard trad rack from med sized nuts to #3 Camalot.

Start in an obvious left-facing corner and climb easily to the roof~ then do cool moves left under the roof and stand up at the far end. Angle left across huecos and neat underclings (Tri-Cams useful for pro)~ then up to easier ground on a faint prow. From here~ either keep going a few feet left into a nice left-facing corner (easier and better protected)~ or tackle the steep wall above via faint double cracks (good climbing but the cracks are discontinuous~ a bit dirty and difficult to protect). Belay at a small ledge by a large old nest.    Pitch 2: Angle right over an easy bulge to a stance~ then climb steep rock via discontinuous double cracks to reach the top. Adequate but not great pro.

The suggested approach pitch to climb to begin this route is ""Cowabunga"".  I would agree with that statment.  From here five more excellent pitches grace the route.  The rock is solid~ and requires all the climbing disciplines.  After five pitches~ get into hiking/scrabling mode till the last 80' of the buttress.  There is a 5.7ish pitch to the summit.  I was confused where this pitch was~ but I did find it~ and here's the best was to explain its location.  When you come up from the saddle (looking at the topo on pg 126 in the guidebook)~ don't look for a straight lined offwidth like that in the drawing.  The last pitch starts in a crack that goes up for about 12' then forces you the traverse right via face holds towards a right upwards arching off width.  The rest is easy to follow.  Rumor at Grand Junction REI is that the upper 1/3 of this route fell off.  Do not believe their beta! Fun route~ more like a mountaineering ascent after the first 2/3.

It took us just over 2 hours bottom to top on this one. The rock is mostly solid~ the protection is mostly good (though well-spaced at times)~ and the line is mostly obvious.    Half Day's Work starts up in the right-facing corner system to the left of the start of Man Overboard and Portal. The route starts by ascending up this system in 2 pitches total continuing up and left the entire way past some old pins~ particularly 3 old pins in a tight group near the top~ near a crux~ and just before a grassy ledge. With judicious use of slings~ this can all be linked in a single pitch just under 60m long.    From  belay on that ledge~ the route goes slightly left and then up and right on slightly lower angled rock with an easier technical grade but occasional short runouts. The route leans hard right here and crosses up and over a peerless slab of rock to reach a large ledge with another old pin belay from the 1960s aid ascent. This lies just to the right side of the last 20' of the major buttress that lies up against the main cliff~ and can be backed up with gear. It is perhaps 120' for this pitch.    The next pitch climbs up from the pin belay and left onto solid rock. The right-facing corner to the right of the belay is overhung~ separated from the main wall~ and dirty/chossy. Go up and left then back right at the very peak of the buttress~ then pull up to and into a chimney on the right (poorly protected in spots~ but moderate) or a left-facing corner on the left (more technical~ but less of a grunt)~ and shoot up more than 60m to the top of the wall~ belaying if you feel the need~ or simul-climbing for a way otherwise~ unless you have an 80m rope.    Arrive on the top~ and find something to belay off of that you feel good about.  It took me some searching to get a long cord around some big boulders that were bomber.

The crux lies in some fun and secure jamming and jugs coming out a left-leaning overhang at the right side of the old aid roof.  The remainder of the climbing is mostly easier~ mostly solid~ and it is all well-protected.    The route starts up a steep crack system (5.7) just below and right of the old aid roof. This lies just to the right of a lower angle system that might be more commonly used.  Despite its steepness in a few spots~ it is not hard.  It may be about 5.7 or 5.8 with good protection.  The angle reduces as you approach the roof~ and you may notice a fixed angle in a horizontal crack in the last small bulge before the roof.  Come up and into the roof and place a hand-sized cam in an overhanging~ left-leaning crack behind what looks like a huge chockstone that forms the right-hand side of the roof and climb out that on jams and jugs.

This route is not in the guide~ but I've eyed it more than once over the years. We finally climbed it~ thinking it might be 10 or so~ but since the gear looked to be good~ so why not have a go? It turns out it's 9- or so with very good gear and very good climbing. What looks like the crux~ moving left where DtD starts its real climbing~ turns out to be easy. The actual crux is above the tree in the green corner. The corner eventually blanks out. Move up and right to get some decent holds. From here~ the best choice is to continue right into upper DtD. We chose to move left around the arete into a left-facing corner and up to a questionable anchor. Chuck tried to continue up the corner to the DtD anchors~ but it got hard~ and he had little gear~ so we ended up backing up the anchor in the corner and rapping from there. This anchor seems to exist for those who rap from the top of Grandmother's Challenge with a single rope.    Route details: start as for Darkness 'til Dawn or just left and climb up to where DtD enters the crack system on the right wall. Instead~ move right and layback up to gain the groove. Moderate climbing leads to a small tree. You could move left here into the left facing corner~ but instead~ continue up the green corner above. Where it starts to blank out~ make a move up and right to get some decent hand holds. Either move right to DtD or stem left to the arete and then left around the corner and up to the anchor.,Standard rack to #2/gold Camalot. If you continue to the Darkness 'til Dawn anchors~ you'll need a 70m or double ropes to get down~ or will need to downclimb a bit. If you finish to the left~ be prepared to back up the fixed anchor.,7

This seemed to be the buttress 'below' route #1 in Rossiter's topo. From the normal approach to the Bihedral~ just before the scrambling starts off of the trail~ take a sharp left and go west to a short buttress with several bolted routes on it. This is the second bolted route from the right~ starting about 15' left of Leave No Trace.  See ?beta photo?. We found this route after the westward walk-off from the Bihedral route.      The route is safely bolted~ but without long slings~ the rope runs funny~ particularly between the 2nd and 3rd bolts (or was it 1st and 2nd) where the rope goes sharply left over a dark sharp corner/flake. Using 2' sling on the lower and upper kept this a little better. It's not a bad climb~ there's just not much to it. Rap from the rings to keep from abusing your rope; don't lower off.

The first good rock to the right about 10'~ is the route~ Bottlenecks (5.9~ *).  It is the first~ nice dihedral~ which starts very small~ but grows larger.    Bottlenecks is a route with a cruxy start and then an additional crux or two as you move upward.  The rock is reasonably solid~ but need a little lichen removal before it is truly ""clean."" The pro is reasonable the whole way~ although not always in your face.  Many horizontals along the way make great ""thank god"" holds for rest.  This route can be lead with a light rack.  You will reach the top of the Upper Construction Zone buttress after 60 feet of interesting~ but not great climbing.    To descend:  From the top of the vertical rock~ you scramble up and left (W/NW) to a large pine tree~ at which there is a solid fixed rap station.  This station is presently 2 independent tied slings around a solid tree and a single leaver biner.  It needs a quick link or two added or to replace the single biner present.

The route trends slightly right to the anchors~ so when you lower off~ you'll have a good chance to toprope the alternate roof starts down low.,6 bolts + a 2-bolt anchor.,17

It begins in an alcove on the NE face~ West of the obvious splitter offwidth. It is not very good~ but from it~ you can see some good routes! Entirely Forgettable.    The first pitch is a complete pile. Climb up to a traverse on a slopey ramp pass a fixed pin~ and climb up the horrible crack/munge system to a low angled ramp system. Belay before the ledge turns slabby. My partner was terrified on this pitch. 5.8    The second pitch is a little better. Climb into the dihedral~ through a bush of two~ and undercling around a small roof. The undercling moves are fun~ but there is enough lichen crunchin' under your toes to steal some joy. Belay in a comfy spot below the summit cracks. 5.8+    The third pitch can have many options~ and they are all pretty good. There are at least three good cracks to use from the ledge. The best is the obvious handcrack avove the belay. Beyond this handcrack~ follow moderate slabby terrain to the top of the rock. 5.9    I found an old nut with chewed up webbing at the top. I added a couple nuts and a sling of my own to rap off to a large ledge to the West. Two ropes will reach the ground off the steep backside as well.,Standard Rack to #3 Camalot. Some bigger gear can be used on the wider finishes.Bring a couple slings and a meduim nut or two to bail if the fixed gear is missing at the top.,2

Pull the moves to gain a belay at a horizontal crack (hand-sized & larger cams).  5.9~ 110 feet.     P2:  Head straight up the face (9-) off the belay~ passing two nice 3/8"" bolts along the way to a seam.  Continue up seams and face climbing - slightly runout - aiming right through quartzite terrain to find a suitable spot to belay near the huge P3 dihedral of Barfy's Favorite.  5.9-~ 120 feet.    P3:  Bearing right~ climb the face~ with cracks~ above~ passing a large dead tree.  This face is ""around the corner~"" so to speak~ of the P3 dihedral of Barfy's.  The angle eases and climbing leads to a convenient belay on a large ledge~ also shared with Barfy's.  5.7+~ 120 feet.    P4:  This pitch is the same as P4 of Barfy's Favorite. Ascend the face or corner rising off the ledge (5.7 either way) to a right-facing corner and roof about 40 feet out.  Pull through the squat overlap on good jams (5.7) and paddle up the crack above to a belay on/near the summit plateau.

The entire route is 4 pitches and is rated 5.9 A3+~ but the first pitch is worthy as a free climb in itself.  The climbing follows a thin~ offset seam through the headwall to the left of Sidetrack. If you like Alice in Bucketland type of climbing~ check this pitch out. It's a great way to get to the start of The Blunt Buttress and The Vaporizer.  I think the only aid climbing Kyle Copeland did on this route is on the thin seam up on P4~ just left of The Vaporizer. The P4 seam has been toproped at 12+ and is an open project if anyone wants to bolt it.  When I first led this pitch with Chip Ruckgaber and Tim Dewitt~ we were anticipating hard free climbing because the Levin guidebook describes it as thin aid~ but there are jugs up the headwall that keep it moderate. I'm sure Kyle free climbed this pitch~ there were no signs of aiding and no fixed pins.  Get a gear belay at an obvious stance where the route intersects Sidetrack in the large~ right-facing corner. There are a couple of fixed nuts there. It is possible to rap with 2 ropes to the ground or two raps with 1 rope to the Redguard anchor. A 70m rope is needed.  Continue up The Blunt Buttress~ 5.11~ 5 bolts to be installed April 2018 or Sidetrack to The Vaporizer.  You can also do this as one 60m pitch from the ground. Long slings are needed.,A standard rack. Maybe double up on #3 Camelot size so you don't have to back clean a bomber cam below the roof. There are good cams below the overhang and just above it. Some tricky nut placements along the seam keep it at PG-13~ but if you miss those~ it will feel pretty spicy. Long slings are useful. Save some large nuts or medium cams for the belay.,3

There is a large boulder on a grassy knoll about 15 feet above the top of the crack that can be slinged for an anchor~ or there are some cracks available for the anchor 20 feet above the boulder.  Be sure to consider the traversing nature of this climb for protecting the follower when setting your pro and anchor.  Watch out for small pesky cacti at the top of the crack.

It has a little lichen and loose rock but no more than most of the other alpine walls in the park. The long approach means that you have a good chance of being the only party on the mountain. (although if there is another climbing party~ it will likely be on this route) The climbing is sustained in the 5.7 - 5.8 range and offers a little bit of everything... snow~ stemming~ laybacks~ hand cracks~ chimneys etc. You won't see the storms coming from the west but you'll get some terrific views of Wild Basin!    To reach the base of the route you have a few options. A) Climb the obvious snow tongue on the left. B) Climb a couple easy pitches starting just to the right of the snow. C) Climb the ramp~ which approaches from the bottom right. (4th class and loose) I started down this ramp once and quickly decided that it was too nasty. It is probably better going up. My preference is the snow if it is soft enough to kick steps.    Once you're above the snow/easy pitches/ramp~ an easy scramble up flower-covered grassy ledges and white rock leads to the base of the route proper.  This description assumes you are using 60-meter ropes.    (1) The guidebook says to climb a 5.5 chimney on the right. I haven't climbed this pitch but it looks somewhat boring. A nice alternative is the beautiful 5.8 dihedral on the left. It has decent pro and offers some excellent stemming.     (2) From the top of the first pitch~ you have a choice of following the huge right-facing dihedral up the left edge of the ramp or a left-facing dihedral/crack system that runs up the center/right side of the ramp. This is a description of the right option. Stretch the rope up to a small ledge below a 3-foot roof that runs diagonally up and to the right. 5.7     (3) Traverse up and right staying under the roof until you reach a large chimney with lots of features~ including a couple choke stones. Continue up this chimney until it is possible to exit left onto a short ramp/ledge system. This is another long pitch. 5.7     (4) Climb up the left edge of the obvious cleft via laybacks~ stems~ and jams and continue past another choke stone to belay under a large roof. 5.8     (5) From under the roof~ climb a short wall on the west side via a shallow right-facing dihedral. Then continue up another 30 feet to a nice hand crack in an open corner. From the top of the hand crack~ a ramp leads up and right to the top of the route. 5.8    The descent also offers a few options. A) Descend to the south and then the southeast to gain the grassy southeast face of Alice and follow this back to east side of Alice. B) Descend to the south along the Continental Divide until you reach Boulder Grand Pass. Descend on the north side of the snow and take the pass back to the Thunder Lake trail. C) Descend to the north via Hourglass Ridge (class 3) until you reach the saddle between Alice and Chief's Head. Turn southeast and follow the obvious ridge back to the Lion Lake trail.,"A typical alpine rack up to 2"" will suffice. Bring more if you want to sew it up.",11

Once on the ledge below the crack~ step up a bit on good footholds to get your hands in the crack.  As you step up more~ you can transition completely into the crack~ which you can continue until you reach the shared ledge near the top of the route.  There are many face holds and feet~ keep off these if you want to practice your crack climbing.    Towards the top~ you reach a ledge shared by all three routes on this slab - this is probably the crux for many~ as you need to climb up onto a slight overhang. By climbing all the routes on this wall~ you could make various attempts on this top portion.    It is not a bad route if you want to introduce someone to crack climbing - they can switch to face holds if they get tired and it's low angle~ so not as painful as complete vertical.,Most simple would be an assortment of finger and hand-size pieces.,37

Climb up the right-facing dihedral as for PP&BB~ but get onto the ledge to the left before you get to the first bolt. Then climb up a hand crack on a slightly overhanging face to a V-shaped slot and scramble up to the top.    The climbing is no harder than 5.8~ but it's a bit tricky~ and there aren't any rests above the ledge for a while~ so gear-placement can be a bit tough. Not so good for top-roping~ because the route wanders a bit and because it's a tough place to set up a good TR anchor. Nonetheless~ the climbing is quite fun.,Several medium cams (about #1 or #2 Camalots~ maybe a bit smaller for the bottom). Larger nuts may work in places~ but are tough to set well. Long slings -  the route wanders. Bolted anchor at the top.,58

Although the East Face was closed in the summer of 2001~ this face was open.  This route follows a left-slanting~ incipient crack/ramp system.  Due to the diagonal nature of the route~ falls could be nasty even for the follower.  There are some runouts but not really too bad for a Flatiron route.  The 5.8 section is short~ but good route finding skills are needed to stay on the easiest line.  This route gets a lot of sun and is often climbable even in winter.    Approach either by getting into the gully west of the Finger Flatiron (see Finger Flatiron description) or by climbing from Mallory Cave to the notch between the Shark's Fin and Finger Flatiron (5.0).  Note~ however~ that this latter route was closed in the summer of 2001 to protect bats.    Begin just east of a large chockstone.  Climb up to the diagonal seam/ramp~ and follow it up and left~ and belay after 110' where another crack angles up to the right.    Continue up the ramp and place some gear.  The crux move is now an awkward traverse back to the left.  Beyond this~ consider carefully the easiest line~ and seek out places for pro.  The easiest way seems to be near the left hand edge of the ramp (but somewhat runout).  Soon you will arrive on a large ledge below the summit.    You can belay here~ and then do a final short pitch (or scramble unroped) back east through a hole to emerge on the summit.  However~ you can also continue pitch 2 to the summit~ following the same crack all the way from the ground.  This involves an awkward left leaning crack which goes through an overhang~ 5.8-5.9 but well-protected.  If you opt for this alternative~ you can belay on the summit.

10923,Fluffy Goat Butt-Face,Goat wall > Bow Valley > Alberta > Canada > North America > International,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/113260819/fluffy-goat-butt-face,3.6,Sport,5.11,21,1850.0,51.11209,-115.13361,FFA Tyler Kirkland and Mark Carlson    June 20~ 2017    This is a very modern addition to a big wall historically known for stout traditional climbing. This route tackles the face right of the Goat Buttress. It actually starts up an obscure and likely unrepeated route~ established by Peter Gatzsch and Andy Genereux in 2001~ called “Gatzsch Your Goat” for pitches 1 and 2 and again for part of pitch 7~ which was only realized after the drilling began. Fluffy Goat Butt-face was established ground up over the course of a few months~ starting early in the season owing to a particularly dry~ warm spring. Originally climbed at 5.10 A0~ it was then exstensively cleaned~ refined on top rope and later freed at hard 5.9. The result of all the work is a well bolted~ multi pitch adventure with rock quality better than most single pitch sport climbs in the valley. Keep in mind it is still the Rockies~ solid holds become lose in time and there are a couple of ledges that hold rubble. The climbing is technical and steep with wild exposure on the upper pitches. Cruxes are often puzzling and the path of least resistance is seldom direct or obvious. A single 60 meter rope~ 12 quick draws~ 6 shoulder length slings and 2 anchor slings is all you need. Tough finger pads will also help! The route has a long season coming into shape on average years by May and is often good until late September/ early October. It is in the sun from just after sunrise until about 3:30 PM. Parties can expect to take anywhere between 9- 13 hours on ascent depending on your ability to solve the puzzles and your skills as a limestone ninja. The descent is straight down the route via 30 meter rappels which takes 2-3 hours. Double rope rappels are not recommended on most of the route due to the number of non-plumb rappels and prickly stone. Your ropes will likely get stuck. With the hike in and out taking around 3 hours~ a single day~ car to car trip would likely be in the 14-19 hour range. There is a pleasant bivi site just uphill of the start of the route that keeps things more casual if used. The site is good for 4-5 people but no spot is large enough for a tent.   The climbing;   P1: 5.6~ 8 bolts 30m.   Start up the large gully moving onto the face on the left side passing two bolts to a ledge. A third bolt~ which is hard to see from below~ is up and left above the ledge. Step up left of the third bolt and climb a shallow right facing corner leading to stepped ledges and belay to the right.*Good to link with P2.   P2: 5.7~ 7 bolts~ 30m.   Climb up and left on increasingly solid rock.   4th class belay move 20m.   Scamper up slab above belay to the scree ledge finding 2 ring bolt a few meters to the right at the base of the slab above.   P3: 5.0~ 3 bolts~ 30m.   Climb the perfect slab above with the belay at the base of a shallow gully on the left.*Good to link with P4.   P4: 5.6~ 6 bolts~ 25m.   Follow the broad~ shallow gully up and left past two bolts before exiting the gully on the right up initially fractured slab to the belay at the base of the steep wall.   P5: 5.10+~ 18 bolts~ 35m.   The pleasant warm up is over. This pitch is sustained throughout with the puzzle beginning as soon as you clip the first bolt. Moving past the second bolt on the left will give a good start to the cryptic dance above. Watch out for rope drag by using slings (racked at 30cm works well) on some of the bolts under bulges.   P6: 5.10-~ 14 bolts~ 35m.   Follow the right trending ramp above the belay for two bolts before traversing right across a ledge. Climb the steep crack with good feet up the side of a giant leaning flake making an airy 5.9 move on jugs onto a ledge. Traverse right across the ledge staying as low as possible with your hands in the wide horizontal crack and your feet on low suspect looking holds(10-) making a final stemming move into the cave with the belay hidden below the roof on the left.* Pitch 4 belay of Gatzsch your Goat   P7: 5.10-~ 16 bolts~ 40m.   Make a steep move out right from the belay cave into the chimney. Continue up the stepped chimney with wide stemming moves~ exiting left when a notch between the chimney is visible above. Follow a ramp up and left to a 10- move pulling around a shallow right facing corer with the belay up left around a bulge.   P8: 5.10-~ 11 bolts~ 30m.   Carefully move up and left over lesser quality rock to better steep~ prickly rock above~ weaving around as necessary to find the best holds.   P9: 5.10~ 12 bolts 30m.   Slither down and left from the belay around an outside corner into a large right facing corner. Steep moves up the corner (10-) through a notch to gain a ledge and another few meters in a corner to another ledge. Climb up and right from this ledge to a few steep bulges (crux) below the belay. There is a sinker jug under the right side final bulge which is very useful but hard to see.   P10: 5.11~ 12 bolts~ 20m.   Delicately traverse left from the belay towards a right facing corner. Close to the corner climb straight up~ laybacking tiny crimps with small feet to a two finger crimp left hand and gaston pinch right hand. Luckily a jug is a grunt away. There are still some harder moves getting to the belay so be sure to take advantage of the rest stance!   P11: 5.10~ 14 bolts~ 30m.   Climb up the right side of the corner moving leftwards at the fifth bolt up excellent compact rock. Another sustained pitch with fun movement and great exposure! The pitch ends on a nice ledge with the belay up to the left.   P12: 5.11-~ 10 bolts~ 20m.   Cross the ledge over to the right facing corner. Tricky moves lead up the corner to a good rest below the roof and crux sequence. A few meters above the roof is the “golf ball ledge” and belay.   P13: 5.10-~ 8 bolt~ 15m.   Climb up on the left side of the belay towards a chimney above. Climb the outside edge of the chimney avoiding stepping right to the belay until it is at head height and can be clipped from the chimney.   P14: 5.11~ 15 bolts~ 30m.   Continue up the right edge of the chimney as it peters out into the roof above. Follow the bottom of the roof to the right before making a series of burly moves over the bulge on the right edge of the roof. Look for a good jug up and right from a good crimp and pinch just over the roof. Suspect looking but firm flakes await on a small ledge above the bulge. A final bolt and short wall above gain a great belay ledge.   P15: 5.10~ 12 bolts~ 25m.   Climb up and right over blocks to where a few tricky moves lead to a crack. A few jams and laybacks are followed by a blocky roof below a short chimney.   P16: 5.9~ 10 bolts~ 18m.   Carefully mount the choss tower at the top of the chimney~ finding good~ solid holds out right as you leap off the tower into the corner above. Follow the corner up to a small ledge where a delightfully slabby wall is climbed on the right side up a small arête to a belay ledge. *Good to link with P17   P17: 5.9~ 8 bolts~ 12m.   Continue up the corner left of the belay. Climb the corner generally on the left until it is time to carefully move right to gain the ledge~ finding the belay on the far right.   P18: 5.9~ 14 bolts~ 30m.   Step right across the gap staying as low as possible at first. Traverse right a few meters before following excellent featured rock up to an amazing layback flake. Follow the flake to a large ledge.   P19: 5.10~ 11 bolts~ 30m.   Climb above the belay avoiding lose rock~ traversing right after a couple bolts (manage rope drag with slings!). Climb past a shallow dihedral and up its right side pulling a steep move left around an outside corner on large jugs to a small belay above.   P20: 5.11~ 14 bolts~ 30m.   Move up above the belay stepping left at the second bolt. Don’t get sucked into the ugly corner right of the bolts! Finesse up side pulls and crimps through progressively harder moves~ finding the path of least resistance to the left of the bolt line~ to the first crux (11-) between the 5th and 6th bolts. Above is a rest which should be milked before entering the second crux. Follow thin~ sharp crimps to a right hand open hand pinch below the roof. Clip from the pinch and get ready for a pumpy sequence pulling the roof on more razor sharp crimps (11)~ eventually slapping out to a flaky pinch once above the roof. But wait~ it’s not over yet! A few side pulls up flakes lead to a dubious looking undercling. Move off the undercling up and right to a deep jug/hole. A second jug/hole to a hand jam leads to lower angled rock and a delicate step right onto the belay ledge.   P21: 5.8~ 8 bolts~ 20m.   Easy but somewhat loose climbing up the left side of the shallow dihedral to a small choss bulge before the belay.   4th class summit scamper 20m.   Scamper up from the left side of the belay~ crossing a small scree gully finding a final set of ring bolts up and right on a nice flat spot to enjoy the top!   Descent;   All rappels are 30m or less (linking pitch 16 and 17 is 30m) and down the way you came up except from the top of pitch 7. Rappel down and slightly climber’s right to find a ring bolt anchor at the lip of the massive roof. Another rappel from here gets you to another ring bolt anchor down and climber’s right of the pitch 5 belay.   Note;   There are alternate pitches 6~7~13 and 14. These alternate pitches were the original line of ascent but it was decided that the route as described above makes for the nicest line and the alternate pitches are not described. Keeping right at any bolt junctions is the way to go.,12 Quick Draws~ 6 should length slings~ 2 sets of 2 bolt anchor belay slings with carabiners.,9

Cut right under the roof onto the face and execute a few thin face moves for the route's crux.  Belay at a stance.   The succeeding 2-3 pitches are stellar arete and face climbing.  It is easy to head off right to Love at First Sight (11-) and weave between face and arete~ which I think offers the best climbing of both routes.   The final pitch on the arete (10c) is spectacular~ thin and exposed with great stone to a grassy ledge.  Wonderful views of chubby water floating tourists and the Back of the Lake.,18 draws and a single rack to 1 inch offers the best options to pick your own path between the arete and Love at First Sight.

The goal was to clean a line that beginners could climb that basically tops out on the chief. It actually ends at Bellygood Ledge~ and I think the easiest finish to summit the first peak would be 4 pitches on the Upper Black Dyke at a sportingly bolt protected 5.10b rating.    I found it enjoyable~ and fairly 'adventurous' for  mostly 5.7 climbing. There are some loose flakes and blocks on the route and gear placements are not always simple. All of the pitches are 100 feet long or longer.    Pitch 1 - 5.7 Start about 100 yards to the right of the Black Dyke~ up a blocky chimney/corner crack system that is packed tight with table sized flakes.  There is a spacious belay ledge. Gear belay.    Pitch 2 - 5.8 Head up a pretty nice hand crack right off the belay ledge~ probably the crux of the climb and quite nice for about 30ft. Follow ledges and cracks to a belay at a large fir tree.   Pitch 3 - 5.7 Finger crack crux near the top.    Pitch 4 - 5.5 Climb up a tree to the top of a large flake. Traverse right and climb up into a chimney with terrible protection and brittle nasty feeling rock. Gigantic Bolted belay. This is apparently the start of a rap line to use during falcon closures and can be rapped with a single 60m rope.   Pitch 5 - 5.6 Mostly easy climbing.   Pitch 6 - 5.7~ A0 Starts with a nine bolt ladder to reach a hand/fist crack. Belay below the chimney. (Apparently there is a free variation that goes to the left of the belay station up a protectable chimney corner then traverses back right into the start of the hand crack. I am not sure what the grade goes at but I'd guess no harder 5.10-?)   Pitch 7 - 5.6 Fun series of chimneys to the top.   ,Doubles to #2 Camalot~ 1 #3. I didn't use much gear smaller than a purple cam. Mostly gear belays.,25

This can be snow~ alpine ice or somewhere in between. The schrund can be the crux later in the year. Screws could be useful but there is some rock gear on the sides of the couloir. To exit the couloir~ climb a short mixed step which puts you at the col. Finish by climbing the Cosmena-Fonrouge to the top. If the rock is dry~ it is easy. If it’s cold and snowy~ the dry tooling is engaging (harder than M3) but is usually well protected. In general~ you want to trend right on the ridge and follow the path of least resistance. The crux is the 20m obvious dihedral. The summit snowfield usually requires crampons. Descend the way you ascended on fixed anchors of varying quality. Inspect the tat and reset the pitons! Or descend the couloir directly to the left of the Amy which also usually has fixed anchors. This rappel route starts a few meters to the climber’s left of the bottom of the crux corner.,Double ropes~ single rack~ stoppers~ and a few ice screws.

The climbing is easy~ but require planned logistics to the way back. This route is the upper chimney in the first ascent line to the Freira's (Nun's) summit~ and was named in tribute to a local climber called Amâncio Silva who died triyng to climb the Freira on the opposite face. Usually climbers approach climbing the Frade (Friar) via Normal Route and Graciliano Ramos route reaching the medium upper chimney and skipping the wide chimney start.  P1 - The first pitch goes up the chimney protected with old original bolts to a vegetated ledge. Watchout for loose blocks! Belay from a tree. P2 - Climb a clean slab with two bolts to under some blocks~ sling a tree and go up through the blocks. Belay from a tree. P3 - Climb up the easy clean slab to the summit with fixed anchors.  The way back is the crux~ and can be done in 3 different ways. A) Jumaring the back to the Frade's summit and rap the normal route. When you rap~ leave fixed ropes. B) Rapelling to the west face via Chaminé Itapemirim. This way you have a long hike back up to the car. C) Via a rap line opened by me and Naoki arima with fixed anchors in the southeast part of the vegetated crest between the two summits. Back in the base of the Frade's rappel hike between the vegetation to the south face until you reach a clean slab. Search for fixed anchors. Rap down and to the left to a whole/ledge with anorher fixed anchor and rap again to the base. Cross the woods to a pasture that will lead to Chalés do Frade hotel.,bolts and natural pro,1

Leaving Rio de Janeiro~ access to the upper part of the park is through BR 354~ entering BR 116 (Rodovia Presidente Dutra)~ just after the border between the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo~ and heading in the direction of the cities of Itamonte~ São Lourenço and Caxambu.   Following 26 kilometers (about 30 minutes) by BR 354~ before the city of Itamonte~ is the Garganta do Registro. At this point you need to access the road to the upper part of the park~ which is on the right of the road~ so that it climbs towards Itamonte. The road is dirt and winding~ which follows for about 13 kilometers to the entrance of the park (Posto Marcão)~ where you need to identify yourself and then proceed to the Rebolças shelter for another 3 kilometers.   The Rebolças shelter trail to the Shelves is very crowded and relatively easy. The entire route is approximately 3 kilometers~ which takes about an hour to walk to its base.   The base of the Chimney Idalicio is on the south face and is easily located~ since there is a plate fixed in the rock and the first meters of the track follows a negative cleft with many staples in sequence.   The track is relatively short~ has four rope strings~ where the chimney technique predominates. Its first thread is followed by a stapled slot~ where it is possible to make a fixed artificial~ but at the end there is a compulsory free throw to the double stop. That bid is a half-body slit~ quoted in third degree~ but it's not that simple.   The second one is short and goes in a chimney to a simple stop~ after a block is trapped in the chimney.   The third strand is longer and goes inside the Shelves~ following an easy and natural path~ always using the chimney technique to a simple stop very close to the summit.   The fourth and last row starts with a short chimney throw and then follows an easy ramp~ then make a bid up to the summit.   The best descent option is the normal south face~ which is practically a hike~ with some easy climbing.

In principle~ a very thin (!) sequence follows with a good jug just out of reach. In February~ Pat Burwick flashed the route using these tiny holds; however~ there is a good hand to be found to the right and almost in the chimney and this hold could knock off some of the thin crimps. A large wing span will gain the jug from this edge. While this is a good route on solid stone~ it will probably be done most often using a stem into the adjacent chimney for the first half of the route.

Fun moves in this section and the bolts are at chest or waist for harder moves.  Once you get to the horizontal break~ take a good look above you to determine a strategy for getting through this blank section.  I found this section to be brutally hard~ until I noticed a hold that I hadn't used.  This lead to a good sequence that was quite different than I had been trying before.

Scramble up and slightly left to a bolted face. If you place gear to get you to the next bolt~ be sure to have some double length slings. The next bolt is a little ways~ but the climbing is easy. Crimp and smear your way up an intermittent seam. Look for a good~ small~ and necessary nut placement on your way.

It has been called~ ""perhaps the best line in the South Saint Vrain Canyon"". The climbing moves were originally freed by rope solo (RW) on jugs~ and the bolts were placed accordingly. My own first lead was very scary. Subsequent attempts by Greg Purnell~ Alan Nelson~ and Mark Rolofson (all very strong climbers and much better climbers than myself) led to the consensus demand for re-bolting~ with new placements described in detail. Before this could happen~ and unknown to anyone~ Rob Pizem led the line and claimed a 5.12 something redpoint. After this~ the line was re-bolted as consensus had earlier demanded. Now~ it is well (over?) protected.    The Temptation Arete begins on the furthest East face of TBB in a thin crack and seam. This section can be done on bolts or trad with small wires. Exit the crack/seam to a ledge just below a short technical slab. The arete proper follows after 20 to 25 feet. The top of the arete has a double bolt stance for toproping~ and the descent anchors are another 15 or so feet higher. The arete itself has at least two good solid 5.12 sections~ and overall the climbing never drops much below 5.11.    My own last attempt in December 2000 still evinced a pair of hangs. Nonetheless~ with the redpoint in the bag (?)~ the route should be considered open to all. The Temptation Arete easily gets three stars for the climbing moves~ the continuity~ the quality of the rock~ and diversity of technique used.    In addition~ it provides convenient access to the 5.13c project to its left. This line was bolted and led by Greg Purnell in September 2000 and should be considered off limits until he has a chance to pull the redpoint or until he opens it up to all comers. I tried it by top-rope~ and it is indeed hard.    Per Laura schmonsees: the main anchor is the the first one. It is loose~ easy junk to the second anchor. You can get off the first anchor easily with a 60m. Two ropes are not necessary and only deter other climbers.",QDs only. This route has two anchors~ one at 115 feet and another at 130 feet. It is a double ropes only route. That said~ it may be possible to get off from the lower anchors using a 60 m rope by angling up-slope since the base here is quite steep. Protected by bolts~ it needs at least 15 draws to get to the lower anchor. A short section at the start was done on wires and curved stoppers.    Per Mark Rolofson: the route has 22 bolts and a 2 bolt anchor.,36

At 75 feet~ The Bruise Collector can fork right for an easier finish or left for a second 5.12b crux that finishes up a narrow groove/dihedral with a roof move that gets you into the dihedral. The anchor on the right is shared with Europithicus. The main crux comes somewhere near 65 feet and involves some awkward moves around very blank bulges and felt 5.12b to me (this rating may come down if consensus demands). Overall~ The Bruise Collector felt very ""Rifle-esque"" with lots of body position and awkward stances. Two stars for the climbing moves~ the overall rock quality~ and the relentless pump.

Or maybe it was involuntarily. My partner and I found ourselves in the middle of a full blown thunderstorm 10 pitches up this thing. In a feat of amazing poise and~ well~ luck~ he climbed one of the upper pitches~ runout almost an entire ropelength and climbing directly through a veritable river of water pouring off the slab... ever wonder how those huge~ vertical channels form? A pitch from the top~ unsure of whether bailing could even be done from that high on the climb~ we decided to anyway.  We did learn a few things though. First~ nothing will take years off your life quicker than multiple double rope raps from star drives. Second~ never forget to untie the knots in the ends of your rope before pulling them... Never! Third~ if you take a crap on a climb~ like my partner did~ it will come back to haunt you. Especially if you have to rap the route. The good news? With enough spare biners you can bail off Childhood's End~ even from pitch 11.  The climb is great though~ and I'll never forget it. Characterized by runout slab climbing the whole way. I felt every pitch except the 5.12 and 5.10 pitches were PG+ rated~ *if* the bolts don't fail. With one exception~ every single bolt is either a button-head or a star drive. That includes every belay (most of which are semi-hanging~ by the way). Hanging from a pair of ancient 1/4 inch bolts high on the wall~ I wondered what would happen if my partner slipped on that 5.7 R section... 100+ feet out with zero gear between him and the belay... Really~ it would be a great service to replace all these bolts - at least the belays - with modern hardware. That said~ the climb really is quite good. It's a definite adventure to climb such a huge piece of granite outside of RMNP. This area in the South Platte is absolutely beautiful~ and chances are you'll be the only ones for miles around. Enjoy!  Double ropes are an asset on this climb as many of the pitches wander~ as would be a few screamers for peace of mind.  P1 & 2: Begin a few meters right of the large boulder at the base of BRCM. Immediately right of this boulder is Fields of Dreams Running Wild - you can see a few modern bolts if you look carefully. A little further right is a very low-angle crack with a tree growing out of it. Climb this for a pitch or two all the way across the face to a two bolt anchor at the base of a short chimney (6-10"" crack) at the right side of the buttress.  P3: Climb the chimney (#4 Camalot down low or #2 a bit higher)~ then the slab above past 5 bolts. 5.9.  P4: Step right off the belay to a crack. Up this for 20 feet~ then step left onto a slab with 3 bolts (5.9).  Or~ for a more difficult variation~ step up off the belay then sharply left past two bolts and into a water groove. Up this past another bolt to join the slab above (5.11).  P5: Clip a bolt out left~ then go around the corner and up the slab past two more bolts~ then run it out to the anchor. 5.8 PG13.  P6: From the anchor reach up and clip the first bolt~ climb right to gain the arete and a couple of bolts. Move up and left making a long reach (height dependent) to reach a nice ledge with a two-bolt anchor.  Belay here to avoid rope drag.   P7: Climb about 20 feet up to the first bolt. Traverse directly right about 15 feet to the next bolt (hard to spot).  Continue traversing horizontally right over a ridge to locate the next bolt.  From there spot and climb to two bolts up and a third up and left before the anchors for the crux (12) pitch.  Long draws would reduce rope drag somewhat but the zig-zag nature of each pitch makes combining them likely to add rope drag.  P8: The crux. Climb up off the belay to a finger crack and undercling~ clip a bolt and head around to the steep right side of the wall~ underclinging and clipping bolts along the way. Continue straight up. All in all 11 bolts on this pitch. 5.12-something and easily aidable~ but you'll still have to do 10/11 moves between bolts higher up.  P9: A great lead. Head up off the belay~ clipping bolts. Perform a difficult step left into a water groove and then continue up on easier ground. Sustained 5.10 and 9 or 10 bolts.  P10~ 11~ & 12: There are now new 2-bolt anchors at the top of pitches 10 and 11.  From the belay atop P9 climb slabs up 30 meters and left to find a single bolt. This bolt is out left of the direct line by about 20 feet. Next~ climb up and right 20 meters to locate a 2-bolt anchor. Either belay or plan on simul-climbing.  P11: Continue up thought provoking slab climbing clipping one bolt before reaching a 2-bolt anchor. P12 has no bolts~ no gear~ and ends at a large tree or at the top of the cliff.  Keep in mind this is not a trade route~ the only gear are the bolts and that crystals snapping of or damp lichen make this a focused if not difficult lead.  After topping out~ hike/navigate the summit rock slabs and ridge north.  Locate the anchors at the edge of the NE corner of the formation. It is recommended that you set-up an anchor and belay each other down to the fixed rap station. Down climbing the slab solo is potentially fatal. Make two 30-meter raps to reach the ground off bolted stations.",15 draws/slings.  A set of Aliens is adequate but a big cam is nice to have for the pitch 3 chimney.,48

Gneiss Route starts roughly in the middle sector of the wall~ in the main section that has been cleared of undergrowth.  The climbing starts just left of the pegmatite band; this band holds a nice route in its own right.     P1. For Greg's route~ angle up left toward a small overhang and a tricky 5.11 crux 15 feet off the deck. Some interesting climbing in the 5.10/5.11 range gets you to a double bolt anchor at 90 feet. This makes a fine 5.11 pitch all by itself~ although it still needs a bit of cleaning at the belay ledge--you'll need two ropes to get down from the 120' anchor though.    P2. The second pitch jumps left a bit immediately for a questionable flake~ straightens out and heads for the black overhang above. The overhang can be negotiated on some remarkably huge holds at 5.12a. You can stop just over this roof or continue up the slab for 40 feet more. This provides good access to the Surette Ledge without the hair-ball scramble used when approached from above. Two stars for a lot of good climbing~ largely but not completely good stone~ and the well constructed bolting job.,QD only. This two pitch route can be done with a 60 m rope~ but double ropes makes much better sense all around both for the raps and for the potential to string pitches together. The first pitch is 5.11 and the second is 5.12a/b.     The first pitch anchor is at 120' so be careful if you're only doing the first pitch.    Two finishes can be had for the upper pitch. One ends just above the overhang. Alternatively~ you can continue through the black slab above for another 40 ft and pick up a third double bolt anchor at the Surette ledge.,11

P1. Climb the first pitch of Days of Heaven and belay.     P2. Do the first few moves of the second pitch then continue straight up a thin tips crack (12a). Climb up this seam until you are eye level with a row of grips heading right. Place a good piece of gear high in the crack and campus right. The hand holds are pretty good~ but the feet really suck. One can place a medium wire about halfway out the traverse. Continue traversing until you slab out on the far right shoulder of the cliff. The gear on this route is not easy to place. The RPs and TCUs are all solid but require some jiggery-pokery.    Hats Off is a hard route to on-sight! One has to be good at placing small pro and moderately  bold. The crux pitch is a good candidate for a pre-load. There is no fixed anchor on top.    Descend down the east slabs.,This route requires small TCUs and RPs. Double up on TCUs purple through yellow. Several #4 and #5 RPs would also be a good idea.,4

From here~ hang a long sling and traverse right to clip the first bolt of the route. After clipping the first bolt~ easily reach back and unclip the anchor sling. From the ledge~ climb straight up the striking arête~ using opposing sidepulls in the crack and the arête. At about 80 feet~ surmount a chossy ledge (tons of loose rock) and look up. From here~ a few more clips on a looming/ overhanging white and black streaked bulge protect the chains. Although the holds are very positive and juggy~ a pump sets in due to the steepness. Feel the exposure as you crank the overhanging prow at the top with the river far down below.    Despite never seeing anyone on this thing in all the years I have been going to Shelf~ I thought it was quite fun movement and spectacular position.

A hard~ thin and insecure sequence or a 6 foot dyno gains the jugs in the ripples and the second bolt.  After a rest in the ripples~ clip bolt 3 and head up and slightly left through a wild ~V9 crux section involving slopers~ an undercling~ and a 3 points off dyno to a full pad rounded edge.  Carefully clip bolt 4 and encounter a very non-trivial sequence establishing on the slab above.  With the last bolt clipped~ either walk off up the slab after untying or move a few feet left to use the anchors for Last Supper.    A skilled and implicitly trusted belayer is required to climb this route safely.  The fall off of the end of the crux and getting established to clip bolt 4 has the potential to be quite serious.  A hard catch might be painful on the vertical wall~ but will be necessary to keep the climber off the deck should they fall while clipping.  The 3rd bolt is as high as it could reasonably be and it would be nigh impossible to clip in the middle of the crux even if a bolt were added.  Be cognizant of the risk and manage it appropriately.    Big thanks to Liam Oden and Alex Kirkpatrick for envisioning and equipping this line.  It had been previously scouted by Eric Rhicard (the current last bolt was added as a directional) but passed over as too difficult.,5 bolts.

A pumpy line with three distinct cruxes~ each successively harder than the last.  The first crux is 11d~ the next 12a~ and the last 12b.  Involves intricate stemming and lunging and some significant power at the last crux to avoid the barn door effect.    There is a 2nd pitch.    Per Aeon Aki: The second pitch of this route is a choss pile.

Very cool and  fun moves carry you up and over a prominent roof on an obvious line up the Clock Tower's Upper Wall.    The climb starts directly in front of the tree that's about 10 feet out from the wall~ at the bottom of a prominent triangular flake covered in bat crap. If you are wondering why there are no branches on the tree on the side that faces the wall~ just fall off the route while on TR. Swinging out from under the overhang and into its upper branches will give the term ""tree hugging"" an entirely new meaning. Once you tire of battling the tree while trying to swing back onto the rock~ clip the rope through the bolt just beneath the roof. This should keep you from swinging out while practicing the lower part of the route. The tree will thank you.

How can two routes so close together be so different? No Tomorrow starts off in a pale~ nearly sandy looking crack. The crack is solid and kicks up very continuous and tenuous climbing for two thirds of the route's length. Above the crack the wall returns to Farts style climbing on flat cobbles and shallow pockets. No Tomorrow offers another superb challenge~ out of the sun~ and on largely very solid stone. I usually prefer Farts to No Tomorrow for the quality of the moves themselves~ however~ climbing feels just a bit more uncertain on No Tomorrow and the pro feels a bit more spaced. Nontheless~ No Tomorrow stacks up as an excellent and atypical route for the Shelf. This is definitely worth the struggle.,Ten or so draws and a rope.,12

This was apparently the first 5.12 route sent in Boulder Canyon. It follows a very exposed and overhung line on a beautiful portion of the cliff. It is fairly sustained down low with many technical and sequential moves.  The upper half is easier but still sustained and pumpy~ with occasionally tricky gear placements.     Start at the big chalked flake and work your way up the finger crack to the overhanging~ shallow~ left-facing corner system.  The climbing is solid 5.11 or harder from the ground until you can get into the hand crack about 20 feet up.  I felt the crux was getting into the hand crack at the end of the small corner~ but some feel getting stood up on the flake down low may be the crux.      From the top of the corner~ continue up the crack system with fun and steep liebacking and jamming (5.10+ or 11)~ moving left at the fork in the crack.  At the top of the crack~ you can go left to the anchor on Bell Buster~ or go right to the Cosmosis anchor to rappel.      Very high quality rock and moves~ with excellent protection!  Not necessarily a ""serious"" route as suggested by some guidebooks... the gear is definitely there if you can hang out to place it.",I used 4 green Alien-sized pieces~ plus one Camalot each from fingers (gray) to hand sized. A gold Camalot is the biggest size needed but a blue Camalot could be placed too if desired.  Nuts could be used in spots but are not recommended due to the pumpy nature of the pro stances.  At the top of the crack~ there's an old pin~ and if you move left to the Bell Buster anchor you'll pass (as of 9/07) a cordelette that could be clipped....

All of the difficult climbing happens after clipping a bolt~ so it's relatively safe.  There are a few loose looking handholds between the first and second bolts~ so beware.  Stick clipping the second bolt may be a good idea.    Climb the overhanging face for four bolts to reach a rest ledge.  Power up good holds for two more bolts and then solve the final roof moves to gain the anchors.    The rock on this route looks like it's brittle and crumbly~ but it's actually pretty solid; however~ the rest ledge has some loose rocks on it that end up on some of the holds directly below it.,6 bolts~ there are lowering biners at the anchor.,8

It also accesses The Hinge. The pitch is worthy as a stand alone climb~ so Phil agreed to the separate posting. Be aware that the anchor is a potential bottleneck if parties are on the upper headwall pitches.  Climb a short~ left-trending crack (place a #0.75 or #1 Camalot~ or make a long stick clip to the first bolt)~ then gain a stance at the first bolt. Climb up and right to gain a long~ undercling flake~ and traverse across the flake. Now the fun begins! Climb the line of bolts through continuous and technical terrain to the roof. At the roof~ climb out the rail to the right~ then step left across the roof~ and reach far left to a hold on the face. Easier terrain leads up~ trending left initially~ and then back right to the two bolt anchor.  Due to its traversing nature~ the route must be followed to be cleaned. The anchor is 30 meters from the ground (rap with a 60m rope)~ but a 70m rope is mandatory to lower to the ground through the draws.,14 bolts to a two bolt ring anchor; a 70 meter rope is recommended; and use an optional cam (or stick clip) at the start.,5

This seems about right for the crux sequence on The Strike.     The Strike begins on the left overhang. Power up to a rail system and swim out right to the arete. The first crux comes in standing up at clip four. Moving past clip five is the technical crux and entails a number of tricky and powerful moves. The crux ends when you stand above clip six.

This route takes the huge overhanging/slanting dihedral at the top of the 3rd's North Face.  The best approach is by doing Northwest Passage.  However~ you can reach the big C-shaped gap at the start of the dihedral from College Dropout or another close by East Face route.    From the belay at the gap~ place a #0 TCU~ do a couple face moves and then step out into the void. The whole route can be aided clean (which is the way I did it) with a set of TCUs and cams.  There are two fixed pins and a fixed nut with a huge wire on it~ in the dihedral.  Every placement is bomber.    A small smattering of bird crap will not bother you (if your aiding it) as you enjoy the incredible exposure on this climb. About 3/4 of the way through the dihedral a small crack leads out and onto the east face~ where some runout 5.7 climbing takes you to the top (use slings~ quickdraws if you want to eliminate drag).,A set of TCUs and a few cams (0.5 to 2).,3

Climb the amazing corner to a stance~ 5.12-. Unbelievable.  P3. A short crack leads to a corner and a mantle and easier climbing to a stance below a bolt and corner~ 5.11+.  P4. Climb past the bolt into yet another amazing corner. Belay at a stance below a shallow corner/slot~ 5.12-.  P5. Climb the slot past a roof. 5.10. A ledge and a short difficult corner follows~ 5.10.

Variation directly to 2 Boulder Bivy: Belay after 200' and then step a little right and go up obvious 5.8 flake corner (nice). Some slightly mungier and harder climbing tops out on the bivy.  P7. Climb a black corner (5.11a) stepping out left when convenient and finishing at the base of a obvious thin crack in a wide dihedral. An easy 50' traverse can go from here to the 2 boulder bivy.  P8. 50 feet right of the two boulder bivy. Climb a shallow splitter through a black streak. When the crack peters out~ step right~ then up and left to a bolt. A difficult leftward traverse (11d) ends at a two bolt belay~ 5.12. Stellar.  P9. Follow a shallow crack~ then faceclimb right to a bolt and mantle move to a ledge. Step left into a shallow corner and another ledge with a small crack for gear. Step down and right~ then up to a rampy corner. Follow this to the top and a good ledge~ 5.11.  P10. Ignore the flake going out left. Go up into twin cracks then face climb past a seam to a ledge (12-). Continue up a left leaning corner past a bolt (12-) to belay stance. Minus too much rope drag~ you can continue another 40 feet up 10+ to a chain anchor (the third station on Astro-slog raps).  P11.

There was an excellent mini-guide in Rock & Ice No. 81 with a story about the FA of this route and an adequate topo. According to this: three hundred feet below the second Cruise Gully rappel~ at the start of the traverse to Journey Home~ begin the route at the second tree. It may be a little confusing to sniff out the start of the route.    P1. Climb unprotected 5.8 to a right-facing corner with some 5.9~ to a ledge. This is a long pitch.     P2. Traverse up and right in an open book~ then move up and left to a bolt.  Traverse straight left (5.10+) past 2 more bolts to a semi-hanging belay at 2 bolts (strangely~ this anchor is just above a nice little stance). This is a patently dangerous pitch to follow; the second may want to practice the 5.10 moves still clipped into the first bolt~ then unclip to follow - if you blow it you could swing a long ways and get hurt. Variation: Andy Donson climbed straight up from the belay (5.11c R or X) instead of doing the 5.10+ traverse~ skipped the 2nd belay and joined the 3rd pitch.    P3. Move a little left~ then climb a continuous stretch of difficult face past 4 bolts through a bulge~ and punch it to the belay. This is brilliant climbing~ 5.12b. There is a small flake which you crank on that may snap on somebody.     P4. This is the crux pitch. Climb a difficult (5.12a) right-facing corner with poor pro (RPs~ TCUs) past a bolt~ then follow the bolts through some of the best face climbing in the canyon~ very spicy 5.12 b or c. The crux is a tenuous standup move on a tiny crystal~ using a shallow~ rounded crescent hold with your left hand and not much else. It is a long pitch ending at a nice ledge. This was bolted on the lead. Several very good climbers have backed down from this lead due to the fall potential from the crux.    P5. Climb up~ clip a bolt~ then follow a corner to 2 more bolts protecting some 5.11- face moves. Perhaps it is a little runout. Belay over a small roof.    P6. Move out and right with little gear~ then go up (5.10+) to a belay below the obvious~ overhanging corner capped by a massive roof.     P7. Climb up and into the corner~ then pull a hard move (5.11b or c). At the top of the corner~ head straight left to an amazing belay on the arete (2 bolts). This is a wild pitch.    P8. A mediocre pitch leads to the terrace.    P9. (Optional) Climb a vague 5.11 hand crack to the only tree on the rim.  It is better to just walk left and solo off.    I would recommend a stiff edging shoe for this climb. Also~ catch it in the shade or when temperatures are crisp- it would be a total grease-fest if you tried it otherwise. Plan on 6 to 8 hours.,One set RPs~ one set Wireds~ doubles TCUs~ #0.5 to 2 Camalots~ one# 3 Camalot~ a haul line. All anchors are fixed and bomber~ and it is possible to rappel the entire route. Expect runout climbing on anything from 5.8 to 5.12 terrain.,6

If you approach from the Lower Animal Wall the climb comes into view right away as the left side of the bolted arete.  A good winter or evening route which sees its share of sunshine. The route starts upon a ledge 20' off the ground.  To reach the ledge~ you can clip the first bolt of Sun Dog with a long runner~ or scramble up 5.8ish.  Thin liebacks will take you through the first 3 bolts~ to the first 5.12 crux.  A ledge is then reached~ which provides little rest before more sustained climbing using the arete on the right.

Residual dirt and tiny loose crystals can still be found in places~ but all the crucial holds are solid. The line has moves somewhat similar to those on China Doll and IMO provides a good warm-up/training for later.    I suggest linking P1 & 2~ if you are comfortable pulling 5.11a moves above a small ledge.    P1. Climb short 5.9 to a small ramp with a 2-bolt anchor.    P2. Follow bolts past dihedral~ get over the ceiling and continue underclinging to chains.,P1: 3 bolts to bolted anchor.   P2: 9 bolts to bolted anchor.,73

This route is singularly unique for the area.  It always seems like a good route to try when my fingertips have been schralped (to borrow a phrase).     Located about halfway down the trail to the virgin painting~ you can't miss this sharply overhanging roof with two distinct pockets in it. Stick clip the first bolt~ then reach for the first big pocket~ dyno to the positive two finger...then start the crux...mantling over the lip.      Make sure your tendons are ready for this thing~ as the dyno to the two finger could seriously injur you.      I placed a #0 TCU at the very start to keep the rope out of my way.

P1) Climb a low angle slab to a nice~ tight finger dihedral. Then jam your way up the side of a boulder and head slightly left to a short hand crack to a 2 bolt belay below a roof. You can extend the belay back down to the ledge if you use the rope (5.10d~ 35m).    P2) Crux pitch. Excellent rock throughout and awesome climbing. Technical crux tips crack at the start to a rest. Then enduro crux through the roof and onto sustained fingers and .75 / tight #1 camalot crack up a beautiful~ vertical wall to 2 bolt hanging belay that's a bit uncomfortable. A classic pitch by any standards (5.11d~ 25m).    P3) Move left off the belay. Clip the bolt~ then jam in a slightly crumbly flare and get to the foot out right. Falling there could slam the belayer. Make your way up following blocks through a chimney. I went left at the block roof part of the chimney. Some loose holds through this chimney. Eventually gain a 2 bolt anchor in the chimney below a roof~ behind a big chockstone (5.10d~ 25m).    P4) A demanding pitch with all sorts of climbing. This is the only pitch where you need the 4s and 5. Start with a #3/#4 camalot roof and establish yourself in the vertical offwidth above. I dropped both #4s and the 5 in here. Get a rest after the OW~ clip a bolt and start the traverse (harder than it looks). The traverse is #3s then gets bigger at the end. Save a #2 and a #1 for the finish up steep blocks (5.11c~ 30m).    We descended from here so no personal experience on the last two pitches.    P5) Easiest pitch of the route. Climb the dihedral up to the big ledge~ passing some bushes to a 2 bolt anchor. Or if you wanted~ there is a 6c+ sport pitch straight up the face a little to the right (part of the route Flaca I think) (5.10a~ 25m).    P6) Amazing crack pitch up the face to a 2 bolt anchor (5.11a~ 35m).,Double rack from green alien to #4 Camalot. 1 each micro cams & #5 Camalot. Nuts. Two ropes.     I suppose you could take 3x #4 if you were to place 2 in the OW and want one to make the traverse less scary at the end... but I don't know if it would fit.    Maybe it would be possible to rap the route with a single 70m or 80m but I'm not sure. Probably best to just take two ropes.,1

It's certainly not the most continuous line. And unlike the typical long pitches of Cochamo~ the pitches on this route are almost all 35m or less. Still~ what it lacks in continuity it makes up for in rock quality. It's actually a super enjoyable route (IMO) with lots of good crack climbing.  P1:  Find a short steep crack that leads to a high first bolt~ about 100m down and left of the cave. Climb through a rough but safe boulder problem right off the deck~ then follow bolts and gear up the path of least resistance to a large ledge. The ""Index 5.11c"" pitch. 5.11c  P2: Do a very short (about 15 ft) 5.7 up to a large 3rd class slope. Hip belay or make a gear anchor~ bring up your partner~ and hike up the slope about 200m or so to the base of a buttress that features a cool crack that widens from fingers to OW~ and goes around a curve to a bulge. A bolted anchor at a semi-exposed stance marks the start of P3. 5.7  P3: Fight through a hard boulder problem (the upper bolt in the anchor protects it)~ then enjoy great and varied crack climbing until another two bolt anchor up and left. 5.11c  P4: The business. One of the best pitches I've ever had the pleasure of FA'ing. Climb a little bit of clean OW to reach twin finger cracks. Pull through a v-slot roof (1st crux)~ and catch your breath in the no-hands stance above. Make sure you have gear right at the lip below you so the rope doesn't get caught in the crack. Fire through the second roof on thin underclings~ and fight your way to the finish. 5.12  P5: ""The Lightning Bolt Crack."" Enjoy casual and well protected 5.7 squeeze OW to a short traverse~ and then do the 5.7 squeeze straight out of Yosemite to an anchor up and left. Yosemite 5.7  P6-7: Two forgettable but not bad pitches take you up broken but safe cracks and chimneys to an airy belay at the start of a knife-edge ridge. Can be linked~ or belay at an anchor mid-way. 5.8  P8: 4th class across the knife-edge ridge~ and climb low 5th class terrain around the blocks on the other side to the base of a clean dihedral. 5.7  P9: Climb a nice 5.10 dihedral of mostly hand cracks up to a bolted anchor. 5.10  P10: Climb discontinuous 5th class terrain past easier and harder sections using many slings until the angle eases off enough to stop climbing~ look around for the last anchor. I don't recall exactly where it is~ but it will make sense. 5.9  ALTERNATE FINISH  P8a: when you get to the end of the ridge~ don't go up~ downclimb an easy gully to the base of a wall to the left of the ridge. You will be below the ridge by about 50m at the start of a beautiful clean handcrack in a shallow corner. 5.5  P9a: Again~ one of the best pitches I've ever had the pleasure of FA'ing. Climb the beautiful steep splitter handcrack for about 40m until an exposed belay on a stance atop the enormous flake. 5.11  P10a: The quality continues! Make a wild traverse out left~ do a short downclimb~ and then figure out a sane way to make the short traverse left to the next thin crack/flake system. Eric did some sort of trickery to protect this from above~ then made the thin slab moves. Neither of us would mind if someone put in a bolt here to protect the traverse. Not a bad idea. Above the traverse~ climb an incredible and sustained fingercrack layback in a left-facing corner. An amazing pitch~ and a damn proud Eric Lynch onsight. 5.12a  P11a: Climb an OW flake (difficult to protect~ #5 would help a little~ but there's going to be some runout regardless). Belay on top. 5.11- R  P12a: Make a 4th/5th class traverse right keeping your eyes wide open for an anchor. You can rap the normal route from there.",Doubles to #3. Single #4.

This route essentially follows the arête on the left side of the south face of the second buttress of Tofana Di Rozes. The route parallels the classic (and busy) 1946 Costantini/Ghedina Pillar Rib route found in most guide books and this web site. Spigalo Sams crux 7th pitch (6c) crosses the Pillar rib and continues to the right of that route for two more pitches then traverses left into the classic route for about two pitches and finally finishes an independent line out right before moving up into the exit gully (or rappelling).  All belays are equipped for rappel   The route is a fairly serious line with bold climbing. It has occasional bolts supplemented by traditional gear and at times tricky route finding. Be ready for some hard 5.10 moves a fair distance above any gear although the crux pitch (6c+) is well protected at the hardest moves.   Pitch 1: Climb up to the bolt then up to the flake and crack. Under cling and layoff the flake then head up and slightly right looking for the second bolt. From here climb boldly out right and up heading for the point of a pillar that is on the arête proper. 30-40 meters~ 5.10c (6b)   Pitch 2:  Climb up the arête over several roofs following occasional bolts. 20 meters~ 5.10c (6b)   Pitch 3: A long easy pitch with rare bolts essentially straight up the arête on the path of least resistance. 55 meters~ 5.6 (4+)   Pitch 4: Slightly left then up just right of some roofs belaying just prior to a triangular roof. 30 meters~ 5.10 (6b)   Pitch 5: Climb just left of the triangular roof climb then up and slightly right 25 meters~ 5.10 (6B)   Pitch 6: Straight up ending just right of some roofs. 20 meters~ 5.10 (6b)   Pitch 7: Climb the bolted yellow rock up and right to a large roof with a crack in it. Clip the fixed pin or bolt over the roof. A very strenuous move gets you over the roof and is followed by a run-out section (look for a piton and some threads about 4-5 meters above the roof). Continue a long distance to the belay crossing the traverse of the Constantini-Ghedina route. 50 meters~ 5.11c/d (6c+)   Pitch 8: Steep juggy but a bit run-out climbing up and slightly right then over a roof leads to a belay. 20 meters 5.10a (6a)   Pitch 9: Continue up to a ledge below yellow rock. 25 m 5.10a (6a)~ consider rappelling from here unless the summit is your goal.   Pitch 10: Traverse left then join classic route and climb up to right of large roof and belay. 45 m 5.5 (4)   Pitch 11: Continue in the corner/gully just left of the main face moving just to the edge near the end of the pitch. 50 meters 5.5 (4)   Pitch 12 and 13: Continue up on the edge of the face for two pitches independent of the classic route~ or move slightly left and finish on that route. 5.9~ 5.6 100 meters.

The route was originally led in two pitches~ the second being the crux~ the first a 5.11a warm-up.  (EFR's guidebook shows it going in two pitches~ but it was climbed as one pitch shortly after its first ascent).  Jim Waugh~ one of the state's leading climbers in the 80s~ came down from Phoenix to bag the crux pitch using crack-n-ups and the then-smallest microwires for protection.  I recall carrying three full sets of RPs for my ascent~ and so armed~ not having to use crack-n-ups.  However~ John Fowler~ who was likely the 3rd person to lead the climb~ recalls needing them.  We didn't have microcams~ offset HBs~ and other modern trickery during those days~ so whether crack-n-ups are mandatory is an open question; that is~ until you climb it and tell us.    According to notes I took shortly after my ascent (25 years ago)~ the climb is ""very sustained~ multi-faceted"" with ""unique cruxes -- although no crux alone is probably harder than solid 5.11.""  The 1985 guide says ""[s]everal questionable holds may be encountered.""  I don't remember a whole lot about it now~ of course~ so go climb it and find out for yourself.    The route begins in the obvious thin crack right of Cripple Creek.  The crack doglegs left across Cripple Creek about 40-50 feet up~ then continues diagonally up and left.  The thin crack is obvious in the beta photo for Cripple Creek~ showing that route in yellow.  From the crack's end~ a featured face leads to Cripple Creek's second belay.  Take any of the easier lines to the top.    By the way~ Ray Ringle named the climb after an Edward Gorey story~ the first line of which is~ ""A is for Amy who fell down the stairs.""

We worked this from the ground up~ consistent with the ethic just about to be swept aside~ figuring the sequence out by taking repeated falls and lowering to a rest.

Neglected for years until 1980~ it went free at 5.11b by Herb North and John Fowler~ who added a bolt to face climb into the lower part of the crack from the opening moves of Chung King Corner and found a free escape from the original aid line near the top of the pitch.  They named their version of the route Glide Path~ which has since stuck.  That same year~ though~ Phoenicians Jim Waugh~ Brad Smith (before he moved to Tucson)~ and Jim Zahn climbed the North-Fowler start then freed the upper part~ adding another 5.11 section.  Four years later~ the Verm and I managed to nab the entire crack free from its start~ which added the free crux and creates an action-packed mixed bolt and gear climb that I've always thought comes close to Histoplasmosis in quality and difficulty.     If I recall~ a number of the bolts were quarter-inchers~ some that could be backed up with gear and consequently ignored and others that~ well~ you'd take a leap a faith when clipping.  Not sure what's there now.

The system is quite obvious on the approach~ and starts with an obtuse corner in the uppermost Schnebly banding and continues into a more defined Coco corner with a looming roof. A unique line that runs a full range of sizes and styles from sub-tips stem-shuffling to fist roof thuggery. It should provide challenges for all hand-sizes (unless you fingerlock green C3s and handjam #4 C4s that is...).  It is west facing~ and will hold shade until early afternoon (around 2pm) during most of the typical Sedona season.  P1--A bit of face and podded corner will quickly deposit you into the crux~ which consists of about 15' of sub-tips in a pretty smooth-walled corner. Invent beta to pass this (power-stemming and some body English scumming help). Fortunately~ the Schnebly is as solid and clean as it gets for these micro-cam placements!

Belay on a stance. .12-~ 100'  P2-- Ramble over a large block and size up the slanting roofcrack above. Fistfight your way out it and pull into the beautiful corner above. Mostly baggy handcrack with some wider bits and flared spots lead to the dramatically steep exit. The crack narrows quickly here as you pull onto the belay ledge~ but there are ample features all around to help the cause. A pretty memorable pitch and true blue-collar classic! .11~ 120'           ***Due to the steepness of P2~ you can't rappel from the top of P2 to the anchors atop P1.

There's a bit of suspect rock to avoid on this connector pitch~ but generally it's on pretty good patina still. .8~ 50'  P4--The crux pitch (P3) of Metamerism. An easy chimney (with some friable rock) leads past the only 2 pro bolts (use extended slings) on the route into the looming~ A-frame roof above~ reach out and sink some cams in the fat-finger crack out the roof~ and awkwardly work out it using a fortuitous patina footrail to pull the lip and exit the alcove on jams and patina jugs. Belay up and right on a small foot ledge. A very unique and cool pitch that looks like it could be way harder~ but pans out. 5.10+~ 50'  P4--Easy shelves lead to a final roof with a handcrack and patina jugs. Flop onto the flat summit.

Then she abandoned the effort.  Ray never red-pointed it either~ so it sat as an open project.  It's hard to believe it would sit for long because it is a nice-looking line and there are zillions of climbers in the country that could cruise it.  In fact I saw a local flash it pretty easily yesterday (may 2016).  So I assume the FA is unknown.    I normally like routes that are at least slightly overhung.  This one seems dead vertical but I like it anyway because it has an unusual combination of good handholds but marginal footholds.  How is that possible ? Because the handholds are mostly side-pulls and underclings so they don't turn into good footholds as you climb past them.    Most of the route is about 5.11 but there is a definite~ height-intensive~ crux after the fourth bolt.  Climbers who are 6'6"" might think it is 5.11d.  Climbers who are 5'2"" will likely think 12c.  If you are my height (5'10"") the crux is very pretty if you do it right~ and 5.12 seems right on.","8 bolts to fixed anchors.

A heady start leads to some long stemming moves to a complete rest on a ledge; this is then followed by steep~ athletic climbing up face holds and parallel seams.

Do the same dicey start (PG13) as for The Flake~ but at the stance where you get the good~ high #3 Camalot~ instead of traversing out right~ continue straight up via difficult stemming and small wires for pro.  This ends at the top of the obvious pillar with the tree growing on it.  Rest up here~ because after this things are full on.  Continuous~ physical climbing up the overhanging wall with good gear leads to the rim.

There are a couple redeeming qualities of the route and one is that you can sport aid past one bolt and still climb the airy arete above to the anchor at 5.10. Also~ the beginning portion of the route leads to a ledge where another little 5.10 called Hide and Seek can be accessed. It leads to the same anchor as the arete. Climb the first 3 bolts to the ledge~ move right about 20 feet and get on it! Once you're in the anchor you can work the impossible arete or climb a variety of short top rope variations on the featured face.

It is also the descent used for the route Slayer on the north face.  Directions from the large meadow at Deer Lakes Pass: Gain the ridge by scrambling up to the first major saddle along the crest (see annotated photo). Then simply follow the spine to the summit!  One may encounter some 4th-class terrain if trying to stick to the true ridge. Most of these sections can be avoided by dropping a few meters down on the east side of the crest.

Next up to the crest of the ridge~ perhaps a little to its other side~ then perhaps a delicate move up~ and on to the summit. Before committing to any move~ keep in mind you'll have to do it again on the way back.    Middle summit is easier climbing and less exposed.   descent: Return the same way.   Some people like to also climb the (higher) hump about 0.3 miles / 500 meters to the South along the broad ridge - which is fun if you like scrambling on big granite talus.

It's easy to find -- even though it's a couple hundred yards up the hillside~ it's easy to spot from the road.  Beware~ though:  the cave is MUCH bigger and MUCH further away than it looks from the road.  Chimney up the back of the cave past a large chockstone and continue up a wide crack to the summit.  Taller folks will have a definite advantage in the initial chimney    The climb is pretty damn near unprotectable which~ coupled with the extremely crumbly rock~ can make this a slightly nervous experience.  Still~ it's an entertaining little adventure in a nice setting.    Descent is pretty straight forward -- keep heading back and the hillside will pretty much come up to meet you.  Then it's a long boulder hop back to the road.,Not much.  You'll probably free solo it~ but I guess a short rope and a few small to medium pieces could be used if you wanted to.,4

The rock is surprisingly solid and the climb is very well protected for a 4-pitch 5.4 (original rating) sport climb. Be careful not to dislodge small rocks on the ledges~ which could bounce down the route. Some bolts are very closely spaced (especially pitch 3). There are several runouts on very easy terrain (5.0 or easier).    Pitch 1: 5.4 (crux at start)~ 120'~ 7 bolts. After clipping the first bolt~ aim up and left to the arete to find the second bolt; it's runout but very easy~ like 5.0~ and you can sling knobs if you feel uncomfortable. Attach a long runner to bolt 2 or you'll feel rope drag higher up. Afterward the bolts are closely spaced. Belay at bolts at the edge of a huge ledge.    Pitch 2: 5.3~ 95' (or 80')~ 6 bolts. If you wish~ you can shift the belay to another set of bolts 15' from the edge of the ledge~ at the base of pitch 2. Follow four closely spaced bolts up a groove and then traverse up and left past two more bolts~ across the arete~ to a bolted anchor with a small belay stance on the face.    Pitch 3: 5.3~ 85'~ 3 bolts. Climb up and then left toward the first bolt~ which is a few feet to the left of a big hole~ then up past two more bolts to a bolted anchor on a large ledge.    Pitch 4: 5.2~ 90'~ 4 bolts. Climb up past a bolt and then surprisingly far to the left to bolt 2~ then up past two more bolts to a bolted anchor on a large ledge just below the summit. From the anchor~ scramble 10' up a class 4 bulge to the summit; to be safe you can tie off about 20' of rope to the anchor.    The quickest and safest descent is rappelling the route~ but if climbers are beneath you be very careful throwing down the rope and try not to knock small rocks off the ledges. A 70 m rope will get you down in four rappels. A 60 m rope will leave you stranded 15' above the ground at the first bolt of pitch 1~ which should have a quick link on it for a fifth rappel. Two ropes will get you down in three rappels (pitch 4~ pitches 2-3~ and pitch 1).,Quick draws for up to seven bolts per pitch. There are rap rings at each belay anchor.,124

Clip a half-yanked bolt that spins (as of June 2012) and pull the roof.  Continue straight up moderate jugs to the anchors.    Since the climbing is 5.9 other than the roof~ which is 5.11~ the line is not consistent at the grade.  It is consistent in quality however.,Approximately 12 bolts to chains.  Two notes as of June 2012:    The bolt below the roof is half-pulled and the hanger spins.  It has been like this for quite some time and held our falls.  That does not mean that it will continue catch climbers forever though.  This bolt is under outward pressure from the roof above.  The tension on this bolt and rope drag above would be lessened by using a shoulder length sling.  That said it is in the middle of the crux sequence and above a small ledge so a short draw provides piece of mind.    The anchors consist of two unequalized bolts~ the lower of which has a rap ring.  There is currently a quickdraw equalizing the anchors.  We left the quickdraw in place.  A more permanent solution would be a chain.,1

P1 (5.11d): A fun~ steep pitch up edges. 11 bolts~ 100’  P2 (5.11b): I felt this was a sandbag.  It’s tough off the belay but the crux comes just after a mantle move when you have to traverse right past 2 bolts to the anchor.  9 bolts~ 80’.  P3 (5.11b): This pitch is pretty straightforward and a bit shorter than the others.  7 bolts~ 70’  P4 (5.11b): Another long pitch that starts out vertical.  The crux of the pitch is passing a bulge.  Aftwards it turns to a thoughtful slab for a few moves.  Be mindful of a huge~ undercut block just left of the bolt line on this pitch.  It’s probably solid~ but we didn’t pull on it to find out.  Rappel the route with a single 60m rope.  On the last rappel~ it’s easier to go the Divine Vessel anchors if it’s open.,14 draws + anchor gear,16

This route will test your physical conditioning~ crimp strength~ memory for beta~ and your belayer's patience.    Clip approximately four bolts before crossing Pull Me Up left-to-right.  One bolt may be shared by the routes.  Follow the closely spaced bolts as they veer right and upward by using small edges and crimps to gain ground.  Desperate moves give way to a grungy weakness that provides a much needed respite after the crux.  Summon up the energy for one last battle~ clipping three bolts~ before pulling onto a false summit.  Three spaced bolts up easy~ featured terrain lead the climber to the anchors.    While this route is no doubt amazing~ it lacks the perfect rock of its neighbors such as Silmarillion.  All in all a very memorable~ challenging pitch.    The route is named Centennial since it was Scott Ayers' 100th FA.  At 165ft the route is the entire length of a 50m rope~ which may have been used at the time.,19 bolts to anchors consisting of two non-rappellable bolts with leaver biners.

Unlike many of the newer hard trad lines at the Reef this one actually relies on bomber gear to protect the crux secton. It is a striking left angling weakness that leads to a clean corner with thin cracks and critical unusual holes in the lower angled left face. A double length Alpine runner can be used to sling a flake making the bomber thread in the holes a safe endeavor. The thread makes getting good gear in before attacking the corner very safe. Great pro is there but it takes a bit to work out how to get in position to place it. A small 1/4 inch stopper~ green camalot and a finger sized yellow Metolius cam were used here by the three of us who redpointed it. Most will step on to ledges below the bolted wide section and take a much needed rest. Be sure to pull back around do the fun laybacks up the wide section. Once you are back in it you will see why you left those ledges instead of wandering right and up. it also allows you to clip the second of two bolts.Two more cruxes above are protected by bolts and will keep you focused to the end. You will cross a section of the route Treebeard with gear to reach the last bolt. An actual ton of loose blocks and flakes were pried away to make it a safe venture. The caveat to this is that it starts by climbing the first 20 feet of Snow Arch which is maybe 5.8+/9-. The pro in this section except for the first piece~ a Green Camalot~ is thin and in rock that makes me not want to test it. Having said that~ the rest of the route is so good it is worth carefully climbing this less than ideal section.,Doubles from 000 to red Camalots~ small wired nuts to thin fingers~ one alpine draw to thread hole and a double to sling the top of a big flake~ separate anchors with Steel lower off biners.,4

P1: (5c) Climb up the delicate flakes~ placing pro in a diversity of locations and never pulling too hard on anything.

In fact~ stick clipping the first or placing a nut in the crack before it will do a lot for keeping this route comfortable. From the 2nd bolt~ you have to follow the odd crack up and left where you'll find that the crack climbs like a sloper rail in the middle~ making it pretty technically difficult.

The first part is pretty easy~ and some bolts are found on the anchors. The hardest pitch is the first of the traverse~ it goes up and left trough a steep wall. It has many really bad pegs and a few bolts~ if you climb it at A0 take a hammer. This pitch had a fixed rope all the way in 2006. Please remove it if it is still there~ it's not a via ferrata after all. After the crux pitch you traverse for 60m (1or2 pitches) and then come the famous ""17-Meter-Überhang""~ which goes free at 5.10+... The next pitch~ a horizontal traverse (5.8) can be very wet~ no problem though.  The rock is generally rather loose. After the traverse is completed the rock gets worse~ and some pitches are not that good.  When you get to the ringband~ keep going right around.  History: Two Germans were really close to the FA when the Italians Cassin and Ratti started climbing in the bad wheather and bagged another great FA. Much Mayr soloed this climb free and on-sight in 2002~ carrying only a 12m rope and a bit of equipment just in case in his backpack. ",A few bolts and many pegs. Fixed rope was found on the crux pitch in 2006... maybe~ hopefully not though~ it's still there. The pegs are all pretty bad. Take a rack of stoppers and camalots from .4 to 3.   Many draws for the harder pitches (15).   Take hammer and 5 pitons~ if you're able to use them. They are useful~ especially on the upper part.   Helmet is essential for the final pitches~ especially if the weather turned bad.   CAUTION: You cannot retreat from the route once you're behind the crux.

Climb up and left (~2.5 m) on dodgy rock to get to the start of the climb~ clipping your first 2 bolts from this stance.

Then~ this rig is just big dead point after big dead-poin after big...nope~ just 2 more moves and you're effectively done~ reaching up to clip one last bolt that probably no one has ever fallen on. The anchors aren't far above!  Sadly~ this crux is very height dependent (call this the 180 cm height/wingspan grade). As this climb follows a seam in the roof~ there may be alternative solutions for shorter climbers~ but I could imagine adding a bonus letter grade or more!   If you can~ pre-hang your draws. Long draw bolt 3 for sure to make clipping more reasonable~ perhaps bolt 2 as well so you can reach it before lift off.   There is an old button head less than 2 m off the ground~ do not clip this and do not start going straight up this.

Bolts close together at the crux make this a good one to try 5.11 slab~ but it does take climbing a section of 5.9+ or 5.10 slab with pro far apart to get there.    Pitch 1.  Clip the low bolt and make an awkward 5.10 move onto an easy ramp.  This section can be avoided by starting farther right~ but if you want to avoid this move~ you'll probably be better off avoiding the rest of the climb too.  A directional piece above this move is a good idea to protect the follower.  Follow the easy ramp up and left to a ledge below a vertical crack.  Build an anchor here~ unless you have reason to do the climb in a single 60m pitch.    Pitch 2. Start up the slab~ clip the first piton~ work left and up on thin slab to the 2nd pin (5.9+ or 5.10 R) It's rather heady between the pitons but they are bomber.  A few more moves gain a diagonal crack~ and you get more pro~ any cam 1""- 3"" works.  An intimidating but easy move puts you within reach of the first bolt on the final slab headwall.  The well-protected face gets blanker and blanker with the hardest ""surface tension"" moves getting to the final bolt (crux).      An intermediate belay at the ledge below the pitons and/or the final headwall is recommended to reduce rope drag~ although I found it tolerable to climb the whole route in a single  58m pitch- a good idea if you have 3 people.",1 bolt down low~ then 2 fixed pins~ then 3 bolts~ to a 2-bolt anchor~ with some of your own trad gear in between..    1 60m rope works to descend the North side in a single rap.

Catch a well-deserved rest~ and finish on easier but still fun arête climbing.     Definitely solid at the grade~ but tightly bolted~ making it a good route on which to push yourself.,8 bolts to chains. Shares an anchor with the Unknown 5.11a.,3

That same week we discovered the heart-shaped hueco at the crux of this route as proof. Sustained face climbing on great-quality rock leads past the lower half of the route to a big sit-down ledge. An anchor on this ledge allows for climbing just the first half of the route at 5.11b. But look up and~ like cupid~ aim for the heart. Some easy slab climbing gives way to another steep bit of climbing in a shallow corner past the route's namesake heart-shaped pocket and the anchors.,60m rope and 14 bolts (I was feeling the love too~ apparently~ and put in a plethora of bolts.),8

It is rather sustained~ with about the first 30' of continuous face climbing at approx. hard 5.11 with a short section with one or two harder moves.    A bouldery start with sidepull holds and small crimps gets you to a   stance above the small bulge 8' up- this is a fun boulder problem in of itself.  Thin crimp move past the small roof and you can grab a larger flat-topped ledge.  Manteling onto this ledge is tricky~ then a weird move to more crimps~ lets you reach the thinnest and cruxiest section of the climb; bear down on tiny edges or find some trickery for 2 or 3 moves on the slightly overhanging face. Better edges & ledges are above~ and the hard part of the climbing is done after 30' up.    Obviously the ""Flying A crack"" is considered ""off"" throughout the climb but for the most part moving over to it is not too tempting~ so it's not unreasonably contrived.    The line as shown in 'Jemez Rock' is a little off- the start should be independent and just left of the chimney that is the typical start for Flying A.    (I toproped this route -as does virtually everybody else- and I think the only place you could get get any meaningful pro is the horizontal crack under the roof about 12' up. I think if you fell at what I think is the hardest part~ you would deck from about 25' up~ maybe landing on rocks. The climbing gets easier above~ but there are still no more gear placements until almost the very top. I think one would be better off soloing vs leading. Edit: See Lee's note below for beta from someone who's done more than I have with this climb.)",Toprope~ from the 2-bolt anchor for Flying A.

The highlight of the route is pitch 2~ a super-clean~ super-tech~ and super-aesthetic corner system you can see from the ground.  It's the kind that makes the angels sing in harmony when you look at it.  Pitches 3 through 5 are also pretty good~ but then the route quality and difficulty goes down a notch or two from there to the top.  You can definitely rappel the route from the top of pitch 4 with a single 70 m rope via slung trees~ horns~ and fixed passive protection (might need new webbing).  You might be able to make it down pitch 5~ also~ but I'm not sure.  You certainly could if you fixed a couple of stoppers part way down the pitch.    Here's the pitch by pitch breakdown:    Approach:  Scramble up ~50 ft to a large ledge with some pine trees on it. The P2 R-facing corner is a good landmark to shoot for.  Also~ to the left~ look for a thin futuristic 1-pitch splitter off this ledge.    P1:  Step right into a 5.8 wide crack in a left-facing corner.  After ~25 ft~ mantle out and step right on ledgy ground. Climb up and left via hand cracks behind flakes.  Belay on a large ledge with a slung constriction.  5.8~ ~60 ft.    P2:  The biz.  Step left~ boulder up past two pretty crappy pins~ get a rest~ and then fire the thin corner above.  Expect tech-9 stemming and sinker nut placements.  The stems themselves are stable and let you place gear~ but moving up~ well that's a different story.  After about 80 feet~ when the difficulty backs off~ switch to a crack system on the right.  Eventually~ step left around a bulge to a belay in an alcove. 5.12+/13-~ 110 ft.    P3.  Climb up and right out of the alcove on gritty rock (5.9+ slightly run) toward a crack.  Pull a committing bulge that suddenly speeds up the pump clock.  Continue up the shallow right facing corner to another ledge belay.  5.11~ 100 ft.    P4.  Get your legs ready for one more short section of thin stemming in the R-facing corner (5.12-) to gain a widening crack.  About 30-40 feet up~ cut left around a bulge on big face holds (really fun) to a L-facing corner.  Follow the corner up to a large ledge.  5.12-~ 90 ft.    P5:  Continue up the left-facing corner.  It starts thin~ but you can use a wide crack on the right wall.  Pull the roof at the top of the corner~ squirm up through a short wide section~ and belay at a tree visible from the bottom of the pitch.  This pitch looks like it's covered with slippery lichen~ but it doesn't really feel that slippery.  5.11-~ 115-130 ft.    P.5-6:  The route becomes much less engaging at this point.  Still fun~ but much slabbier and with grittier rock.  There are probably numerous ways to continue up from here.  We combined pitches 5 & 6 with a little bit of simulclimbing.  Climb up and right via 5.7 grooves with hand cracks in the back.  Above~ cut slightly left to belay at a decent-sized tree on the right side of a large ledge.  5.9+/10-.  230 ft.    P. 7-10:  We combined these into two pitches with some simulclimbing.  From the tree belay~ traverse down and left ~100 ft on an easy ledge to a large R-facing corner system.  Climb the corner and continue to angle up and right via cracks and ledges to the top.  5.8~ 500 ft.    Descent:  From the top~ hike down the standard descent gully with one single rope rappel near the bottom.",1 set stoppers (extra ~3-7~ selected brass optional)~ 2-3x tiny cams to green camalot~ 2x red and gold camalot~ single blue #3 and grey #4 camalot.  13-15 QDs and slings.,2

Start up the crack until you can reach left and clip the first bolt.  At this point it is possible to move out onto the arete proper and begin the real climbing.  A good sidepull allows a long reach to clip the second bolt before beginning the crux~ one of the best sequences you'll encounter at the bluff.  Reaching from a small left hand undercling~ the right is bumped up the arete until a decent pinch is found.  Smearing the right foot against a ripple in the rock~ the left is brought up to a good edge parallel with the undercling.  This position seems tailor made to generate an uncontrollable barndoor swing when the left hand is released~ but with a deep dropknee you can release your hand just long enough to make an enormous reach to a slopey pocket up high.  A few desperate bumps and you can reach a decent hold around the arete to the right~ leading to easier but still technical moves to reach the chains.  Unfortunately~ clipping the third bolt is very difficult and comes right in the middle of the crux sequence~ necessitating a horrible heelhook.  Some have chosen to skip the third bolt and climb through the crux before clipping.  This should be done with caution though~ as a large fall is risked on a very short climb~ and a grounder could occur.  Perhaps clipping the second bolt with a locking biner instead of a draw would help slightly~ and obviously an attentive belayer is a must!  However you choose to do it~ Kelly's Arete offers some of the bluff's most aesthetic climbing and should be high on everyone's ticklist.,Bolts--Can also be easily TR'ed by leading Jam and Jelly~ which ends on the same ledge.

It might be considered a major variation to Warpy Moople~ as ""Out to Lunch"" shares the start with that route. This may be a small step up in seriousness from Sandia 5.10 classics like Yucca Flower Tower and Mtn Momma. Expect good rock and possibly some complicated route-finding on what is maybe the best 5.10 line on the cliff.  Pitch 1: The first 1+1/2 pitches are shared with Warpy Moople. Start at the highest pine tree below the big roofs. Follow a shallow right-facing corner straight above~ then weave your way left then back right~ then back left again to a belay on a grassy ledge (5.7~ 130).  Pitch 2: Go up and right~ undercling right past a roof~ then go straight up passing a big flake. Move left to a ledge with a piton~ belay. (5.9~ 100).  Pitch 3: Climb above the ledge and work left to a belay ledge left of the biggest roof. This belay has a fixed pin and fixed nut (5.7~ 90).  Pitch 4: This crux pitch is full-on Sandia wildness. Climb right and up a tricky right-facing corner passing a piton (a 2nd pin shown on the topo is missing in 2018). Clip a 1/4 bolt below a roof~ make a thin traverse right 15 to a new bolt. Go straight up technical terrain with small knobs to a crack~ then turn a small roof and step right to a 2-bolt belay. (5.10b~ 110)  Pitch 5: (a) Traverse right and slightly downward 20~ to a short hand crack (rejoining Warpy Moople~ which traverses in from the right). Face climb~ continuing up and right~ sometimes with infrequent protection to a 2-bolt belay on a small ledge. (5.9~ 120). (b) Or go straight up from the belay (see comment from John Kear below).  Pitch 6: Straight up from the belay to a fixed pin. Make one tricky move just past the fixed pin~ traverse right~ and go up to a grassy ledge. Angle up and left~ first climbing past a small chimney~ then along an easy left-trending ramp to a belay at another grassy ledge (5.8+~ 160).  Pitch 7: Stem a weird dihedral off the belay; then straight up loose open corner to the top (5.8~ 180).  There are other options from the belay after pitch 4~ going straight up or to the left; one of those is probably the original route.

There is a huge left-facing dihedral (with a dramatic hand crack on its right wall) 100 feet above the ground. This is NOT the climb. Look for a smaller left-facing dihedral~ with a few trees~ 50 feet left of the huge dihedral~ and also about 100 feet above the ground. Start directly below this smaller dihedral.  1. Clip a piton 10 feet off the ground~ move up and right across some small rounded overhangs. Continue up the crack that leads to the smaller dihedral. Pull up and past a small tree to the next level of slab.  Climb the wall of the dihedral to reach a ramp with a thin seam and little gear/no gear for 20 feet. Climb the ramp to where it steepens and place gear in a crack before making awkward moves to reach a 2-piton belay which can be backed up with a #2 cam. 160 feet~ 5.9. (If you arrive at a tree with rappel slings~ you are on the rappel route~ not the climbing route.)  2. Step up on friction and continue up small cracks. Climb a wide v-slot to gain a face with thin cracks and small pro. Traverse up and left across the slab to gain a large flake~ #2 cam. Pull up and over the flake to gain right facing corner with a large block. Look up to find  3 bolts on the face. Climb the corner/face clipping bouts to a comfortable belay at 2 pitons. 160 feet~ 5.10.  3. Step up on blocks to reach the bolt. Make thin face moves to pull up onto a slab/ledge. Cross the slab up and right to reach a wide right facing corner (not visible from the belay). Stem the corner working up and into the base of a finger and hands crack. Sustained stemming and jamming leads up the crack to a ramp with right facing dihedral and trees. Clip a pin and move left and up a second crack/ramp system for 15 feet. Place gear high and then traverse right to regain the crack in the dihedral. step on or over a tree to clip a pin. Continue up the flared crack past the third pin to reach the top of the crack.  Look right for a small belay ledge with one bolt and a slingable horn~ a thin crack left of the bolt provides gear placements to back up the bolt.  100 feet~ 5.10+.  4. Traverse left along a thin crack with little/no gear.  At the end of the crack make a reach to clip the first of two bolts. Make delicate moves on polished face/slab to the second bolt. Step down and left to reach a seam which you follow to the overhang.  Place solid gear~ #1-2 cams~ in the base~ middle and above the roof.  Make long reaches to gain large holds.  Work your feet up and pull on to the face above the overhang. Follow a wide crack for 20 feet to a treed sloping belay ledge with 1 bolt on the right wall of a left-facing dihedral. 80 feet~ 5.10.  5. Walk left to a gnarly tree to gain access to the finger crack splitting this smooth face~ which is prominently visible from the approach trail. Climb the crack and face holds for about 50 - 70 feet placing small cams and nuts.  From the end of the finger crack~ look for bolt 20 feet up and right above a flared crescent shaped crack. From the first bolt look up 20-30 ft to spot the second bolt.  Climb the face using edges and crystalized pockets to gain the second bolt. Pull up on to a tree covered ledge and belay 110 feet~ 5.10.  6. Follow the left arête to the top of the ridge. 100 feet~ 5.4.,Carry a full rack for cracks from 1/4 inch to 3 inches.,3

BTW~ there is a 'fixed' stopper in the vertical section of the crack and a bail biner on the second bolt. These pieces are for lowering and should not be removed. (otherwise your rope might be eaten)    Also~ there was a fixed piece in the horizontal section that has recently come out (i found it at the base). A small TCU can suffice in its stead.,2

It begins right of the Ranch~ and shares the last two bolts of that route.  Clip a draw while standing on the slab~ then hop on for a burly ride.  The holds are somewhat different than the rest of the Wave.  Expect pinches and twisty body positions to work your way left.  The belayer stands down in a guano/hanta virus filled hole to stay out of your way as you grapple with the cryptic sequence.

The original start~ shared with Sugar Mama~ traversed in from the left following a crack which peters out as it gains the gold streak at the fifth bolt.  Long moves between amazing pockets and small crimps lead up the remaining six bolts.        Four new bolts go directly up the gold streak to the beginning of the original crux.  Start at the eye level flake and do some thin slab moves at the second bolt.  Then zig zag a bit following the best holds you can find till joining the original line.        The upper section has many hard~ long moves up vertical terrain with marginal feet.  I particularly love the ""peanut"" hold which is a shallow oblong pocket for your index and ring~ but too pinched off for the middle.  A pair of good rest holds allow a shake before the undercling and crimp sequence guarding the last bolt before the anchors.      The original guide called this the best line on the wall~ and I feel that the direct start improves the continuity and the aesthetics.

You get to tag the summit and get an outstanding view of Phi Phi.  (there is a photo of this in the Lightner guide.)  The pitches are on the short side~ about 80' or so each~ but this takes advantage of great belay stances.  The route~ or the Oyster Blade in general~ doesn't see much traffic  You'll probably have it to yourselves.    P1:  5.10c - 130 ft.  Come out of the jungle and locate the route by looking at the left side of the formation~ and starting up a face to a corner formed by a giant hanging stalagtite coming off the wall.  Climb up past a few threads and pass left of the stalactite.  Continue up and left~ passing a thin crux near the end of the pitch.  There is an anchor on top of the large stalactite for another route.  A few guide books suggest belaying here.  The FA was not done in this manner~ and it makes no sense to stop here as it is only 50 ft off the deck.  Continue to the next anchor.      P2:  5.10a - 60ft.  Head up and trend just right to a hand crack before moving back left into that graphite grey~ super sharp~ dagger rock.  Easy climbing~ but exposed.     P3:  5.9 - 60ft.  Head straight up!  The features on this pitch are crazy~ there is dead coral sticking straight out of the limestone!  This is the easiest pitch~ but also the neatest for the features.  Take care though~ if you tap on the coral it sounds like you are tapping on glass.  Easy climbing~ but if you fall you will be julienned~ and I dont' even want to think about what your rope would look like.     You can continue past the belay for P3~ about 15 feet up to the summit.  Straddle it and belay off the ring.  Back up the old rope/webbing.  You can scramble between the two summits for pictures and such.        Descent:  From the 3rd (or 4th) belay~ you traverse on a fixed line left to a rap anchor.  Do one 25m rappel and then scramble down the jungle to the base of the wall.      There is a rap anchor in the notch between the two summits~ but it takes you to a hanging belay anchor from 1987.  IT'S BAD!  GO DOWN FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TOWER!  Stay tuned for rebolting info!   ,Bolts.  As of 2/07~ every lead bolt was a Petzl stainless glue in.  Every belay had one Ti bolt~ and one SS glue in~ with the typical Thai setup of a piece of tied rope and big steel ring.  Take some slings with you to back up the rope.  You may want to leave some behind~ so tied slings are recommended.    You need a second rope to do the standard descent.  You might be able to rap the route with a single 60m~ but you might get the rope hung up.,6

Do a few hard pulls to reach a no-hands rest before the crux~ a beautifully featureless sheet of white-orange stone. Crank a hard lockoff to reach the slippery arete~ then figure out how to not barndoor off as you aim for a stance out left under the cap roof.    Though it would be logical to end the route here~ every New River climb must end at the top of the cliff~ so do a final dirty roof encounter~ trending right along a roof flake to anchors on the face (make sure you take a moment to locate these from the ground or you might get hopelessly lost).,Bolts to a bolt anchor.,1

Without the addition of this glued on rock the climb would probably be a really nasty 14- or it might not even be possible.  Even with the addition of the stone this is still the location of the crux.    Start with 15 feet of roof climbing on sculpted slopers.  Clip the second bolt and then blitz the crux swing dyno.  Take a really good rest at the third bolt before taking on a second easier crux.  The second crux involves some small crimps and a long lock off at near vertical angle.  Climb through several more bolts of bizarre rock~ some of which is purple.  One more hard move awaits you as you clear the final roof.  It is kind of bewildering hanging the draw at the roof so stay focused.  Fifteen more feet of steep jug hauling takes you to the top of the cliff.  Lots of variety on this one.

The climbing features powerful and technical movement that is probably easier if you’re taller~ but also doable for the shorter powerhouse climber.  Share the same start as Black Rider~ but trend left to move under the first bolt. The difficulties begin immediately from the first to second bolt~ which require either a massive static reach or a precise dynamic power lunge. Squirm or smear your way up to a no-hands rest under the small roof. Clip the third bolt from a left-hand undercling~ and then immediately enter the first crux involving power crimping getting over the small roof. After this sequence~ clip the fourth bolt~ and enjoy easier climbing to an interesting~ mediocre rest at the fifth bolt. After the rest~ the second crux there ensues with very techy~ powerful~ precise movement on rad pinches~ pockets~ and slots. This crux is highlight of the route~ but also can be pretty show stopper~ until you unlock the betas. Clip the sixth bolt and enjoy sustained~ pumpy 5.11+ to the anchors.

Yes~ the compass must have been sprayed by a skunk due to the horrendous smell emanating from the flat~ magnetic device. The compass was hung from the mid route rap anchors as a funny object to be found during future ascents.    The lower slab bulge crux and mid-route open dihedral have similar crux difficulty. Holds are easier to see as you climb the line. At the rap bolts~ you can either rappel down 60 feet~ belay~ or simply clip and continue 30 feet climbing easily past another bolt on your way to topping out this route. Most of the lines along Providence Main and South Walls were originally climbed to the top of the cliff.

Park at the group site and head up the Indian Hollow trail towards Sugarloaf. After an hour or so~ stay right at the fork with a miniature sign indicating the approach to Sugarloaf goes left. The trail remains easy to follow until it crosses 2 more drainages~ then you’ll have to start cairn hunting as it gets consistently steeper~ looser~ bushier~ and harder to follow. Keep your eyes peeled for many artistic cairns~ including one in a small tree. If you’ve bushwacked elsewhere in the Organ Mountains~ you’ll find this approach quite tame~ but if you haven’t~ you may find some choice words escaping your mouth on occasion. A very prominent black streak high on the face is directly above the start of the route.    Unless you are hiking in with John Hymer himself~ I’d recommend overcoming your Luddite tendencies and downloading the approach/deproach GPX file (link at bottom) into your phone.    Once you’ve located a camouflaged bolt about 15’ off the ground marking the start of the 1st pitch below a long~ right-angling ramp system~ drop your pack~ dump the dirt and rocks out of your shoes and take a well deserved break. If you forgot your headlamp~ better make it a short break.  Climb: Although the climb is well protected with many bolts~ it feels like adventure climbing at its finest. Crazy lichen abounds on all but the 3rd pitch~ and some of the bolts are difficult to find amidst similar-colored lichen. Fortunately~ all of the belays are bolted~ marking the end of each pitch. Once you are accustomed to climbing on the lichen~ you’ll find the movement up this steep route absolutely stellar! If you find yourself fiddling in marginal gear~ or placing gear in questionable rock~ look around for a bolt.   P1: 5.10~ 110’ - The odyssey begins! Clip the first bolt~ then move up and right into a small corner. Arrange some gear and mantle (crux) onto the ramp. Follow the ramp past a couple more bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.   P2: 5.11-~ 180’ - Continue up the ramp finding gear in the corner and some bolts. As it gets steeper~ keep an eye out for hidden bolts on the left face. Work up into a roofy/stemmy/undercling~ then bust a move left (crux) and over to a 2-bolt anchor.   P3: 5.11~ 110’ - Wander up the wonderfully clean rock past a couple bolts to some difficult moves left. Continue with more sustained moves protected by bolts to the bottom of the black streak and a 2-bolt anchor.   P4: 5.12-~ 115’ - Study the shallow chimney-like slot above you and make a plan. Do some 5.10ish moves up and clip the 1st bolt. Likely~ abandon your plan here~ and thrutch up the slot (crux) praying for grippy lichen underfoot! If Minerva answers your prayers~ clip the 2nd bolt and relax; the rest of the pitch is much easier. Head up and left towards the chimney feature finding good gear and a no-hands “Honnolding” rest along the way. A fun mix of climbing behind the chimney eventually trends right to the top of the black streak and a 2-bolt anchor.   P5: 5.11-~ 110’ - Now that you’ve done the crux P4~ prepare for some adventure! The lichen and route-finding on this pitch may make it feel harder than it really is. Persevere~ use your imagination~ and enjoy the great movement up the rock. Eventually~ you will arrive at a ramp with a bolt in the middle and a clean dihedral on the left. Clip the bolt and head directly left~ escaping the dihedral and up to a 2-bolt anchor.   P6: 5.11+~ 150’ - Make unprotected moves out an easy slab on the right and locate a line of bolts going up the steep face above. The climbing gets gradually more difficult up to the apex where you’ll encounter a solution underclingy-finger slot. Crank through here (crux) and arrive on Onion Ledge and a 2-bolt anchor. You’ll find some wild onions and nice soft moss to stand barefoot in. An enjoyable place to be!   P7 - P12: Best simul-climbed with the occasional belay as necessary. Follow your nose through some 4th class~ sometimes bushy scrambling towards kind of a small saddle. From the saddle~ you may be able to look down into a cool treed area high on Minerva’s north flank. From here~ traverse left under a boulder (good handjams) and then head up to the start of the Knife Blades. Hand traverse across the unique knife-blade ridge~ passing a 2-bolt anchor for the top pitch of SE Face route. Step down to another~ duller knife-blade ridge and walk across that to a 2-bolt anchor. A move of 5.7 above the anchor leads to more 3rd/4th class scrambling. When you think you see the summit blocks~ go around to the right into a 5.4 dihedral. At the top of this dihedral walk up the final slab to the summit.     Welcome to the very small cult of pain-worshipers that have ascended Minerva’s Temple. Look around for an ammo box~ and add your name to the nearly empty summit register.  Descent: Scramble down as far as you dare~ before making a series of single-rope rappels~ off of whatever features you find handy~ finding your way back to Onion Ledge. It may be easier to belay or solo back across the knife blades~ otherwise~ rappel on their NW side getting back to the saddle. Bring some extra webbing and leaver biners just in case.    From Onion ledge~ make 5 double-rope rappels to the ground. The first 3 rappels are from anchors you used on the climb. The last 2 are climber’s left of the route. By now~ you’ve probably learned to go slowly as the bolts are sometimes difficult to see~ but if you haven’t learned this yet~ rap slowly as the bolts are sometimes difficult to see! It may be possible to rap this route with a single 70m rope~ but this hasn’t been verified. If you do~ please report back here.

Then take a nap. Again on the upper wall more featured rock but few good holds in a corner gets you to the anchor. I recomend Z-clipping at the anchor since the last bolt and the anchor are so close it is a pain to clip regularly and your waist is still below the last bolt anyway when you clip the anchor.  Additional description from Aaron Miller the FA: Fun and tricky climbing through some unique features~ this route has two separate crux sections separated by some easier terrain. The fact that the route is broken by a rest-section does not mean you can let your guard down~ the top moves are challenging and excellent on beautiful rock.  Original Online guide description from Rick Bradshaw:  At least one individual has had his eye on this piece of rock for a while. A crucial hand hold popped off on an early ascent~ turning the moves past the first bolt into a bit of a boulder problem~ requiring an attentive belayer. A much needed no hands rest breaks up the sustained climbing on the lower and the upper sections.The best sport route of its grade at Diablo (well~ it's the only 12- sport route at Diablo --as of 2004--~ but it's really good).,10 bolts to anchor,8

There are two pitons that can be backed up with gear. The crux of the climb is likely the final 50ft of P1 (5.5-5.6). Great protection.  P2 - 150ft - Continue to follow the crack system straight up. (5.5G) Once again~ great protection. This pitch ends below a roof~ just to climbers left of the weakness in the roof. This is a half-hanging gear anchor involving mostly hollow flakes. Easy gear can be placed using these flakes. Looking just above the flakes~ about a foot below the roof~ is a bomber 0.3 (small blue) cam placement in solid rock.

Two rap options are 50ft climbers right about 50ft where the edge of the slide meets the trees. Option #1: Easily traverse 50ft right and slightly down to two trees that have obvious rap burns around them. Many people just rap directly from around these trees (unfortunately). I am not sure why these trees do not have a rap station around them instead. Option #2: climb a 4th pitch up and right about 80ft through a wet and mossy slab to a fixed (tat) rap station that can be seem from the top of P3. I believe its easier to pitch this out than traverse right and scramble up unprotected~ although the latter is also an option (you'll see why people are just using option #1). Use knots at the end of your ropes for the first rap. Rap a rope-stretcher (from option #2) to a hidden rap station (tat) climbers right of the the rap line in a small right-facing corner that becomes apparent once you're over the bulge and near the end of a 60M rap. Rap from this station to 3rd bolted rap station about 50M down.

Small stoppers helpful above~ but the right placements can be tricky. Two bolts at tree ledge. Top-roping from here is not recommended because the top edge of the route is very sharp.

The first couple moves were not protectable and worth a spot.     P1. Climb up and left to the top of a large pedestal. A small group of trees on the left side makes for a good belay station. ~50ft.    P2. Continue to the left of the belay into and up the obvious large corner. There are two rap/belay stations in this corner.  I opted to belay from the second station because of the overall arc of the climb. Rope drag would have become a major issue if I continued. ~50ft    P3.  Traverse out right on an easy ledge just above the roof. I found a #2 placement at the end of this traverse.  The climb goes up and right diagonally to the GT ledge. Lots of lichen and dirt on this pitch. ~50ft    P4.  A bit of a scramble to the top with several large ledges. I came across a piton about half way up this section.  The route ends in a sea of brambles~ which I had to beat a hole in to even get over the lip~ then search for a living tree to belay from. Lots of lichen and dirt on this pitch. ~60ft    We scrambled another 10ft to get to the true top.,A standard rack of cams and nuts up to a #2 protects this route well.     There are several rap stations in the major corner on P2.  I came across a piton in the upper section but may have been off route.  We topped out and used two rap stations about 60ft to the right~ these were long two-rope rappels.  The first rappel ended with three options within 40ft of each other for the second rappel~ the middle one is the obvious one.  The second rappel goes down and right to a large pine tree. From here you may scramble down to the right or rap for a third time off the large pine.,2

The start is located at a creaky flake just right of Son of Bitchy Virgin's right-facing corner. Begin by climbing the flake and pulling a short roof to a ledge.  Continue straight up the face towards a slung block and belay here (or on gear above).      For a second pitch~ climb straight up the face following the best clean holds (trend right; some might find this section a little run out...it gets a PG rating in the Williams guide) before jug-hauling the last bit to the GT ledge.  Rap to the ground in two ropes~ or to the slung block with one.    Overall  a nice (2 star - Williams) route to do in you are in the area.,Mostly standard gear...saving small stuff (blue and black aliens) for the second pitch.

P1:  Start up the corner~ using the crack and face holds on the left to advance.  At the roof about 15-20 feet up step left and continue following the corner upwards.  There is a crux bulge~ but in my opinion all of the climbing is pretty straightforward 5.6 or easier~ and is well-protected.  As you get higher there are numerous left-facing flakes in the corner that provide good holds.  At about the 80 foot level~ there is a dirt ledge at which you can build an optional gear belay-- I did not; I finished the climb as a single pitch.    Original P2:  A shorter~ easier pitch.  After a few more moves upward~ the rock to the right eases off to a stairway of blocks up which it is easy to climb to a large oak tree with a rap station.  Dick Williams describes this as a dying oak tree in his 2004 guide but as of June 2010 it seemed to me to be very much alive and thriving (but see comment below; as of 2013~ not so alive).  From here~ a single 60 meter rope rap just makes it to the ground.    Direct finish:  Williams describes a new direct finish in his 2004 guide~ which climbs straight up from the end of pitch 1 to a small roof (crux)~ after which one climbs straight to the top.      I explored up to the roof~ found the hold just under the roof to be a bit less of a jug than I expected~ and then couldn't tell where to go.  There is a lot of lichen over the roof and it seemed unclear to me whether to go left or right; there were no obvious holds I could see.  It did not appear this variation had seen a ton of traffic.  The tree at the top is higher than the traditional finish~ so you will likely need two ropes to rap~ or you can walk a short distance to the Ursula rap station~ which will get you down with a single rope in two raps.,Standard rack.  Plenty of pro.,81

Go across the slab to a right-arcing corner~ up this~ and continue up until you can make a left traverse on steep blocky terrain (a bit of optimism here).  Climb up to another right-facing corner and follow it (crux) until it ends~ then climb a short blocky face to a nice exposed belay ledge on the arete.  Make a belay.    P2 - the only real reason to break this up into two pitches is the exposure of the beautiful belay. Head up and left avoiding loose rock and lichen for 30 more feet on not as nice terrain (5.2 or so).    Rap with 2 ropes from the Eowyn pine tree,Normal Gunks rack.

From Rick Cronk: The FA of the offwidth below the Bloody Bush ledge~ originally known as Rusty Jam and now appearing as a variation at 5.9~ was done by myself~ Matt Muchnik~ Kevin Bein~ Rich Perch and John Bragg in 1975. It involved a complete ascent of three pitches to the top. Bein~ Perch and Bragg continued on their way along the Trapps from the top of the first pitch. Not knowing of the undocumented 1950's ascent of Bloody Bush (Easy Street)~ Muchnik and I continued up that corner to the GT. Our third pitch wandered up just left of Rusty Trifle to the top. After 9 years Swain and party added a new separate 2nd pitch and a new name. So it goes.    From the ledge~ make a big step up and out left onto a smaller ledge~ then climb up 10 feet or so to a small roof; just above the roof there is a shallow seam. Move slightly left until you are standing on good footholds~ then go straight up to a large horizontal. Back right a few feet~ then climb straight up to a large pine tree. As described~ this pitch is often empty~ and has good protection (albeit with a bit of work) and interesting moves.     There are several pitches to be climbed from the GT ledge. Straight up from the rappel tree is easy~ 5.5 or so~ jugs and overlaps to a right-facing white corner (this is P3 of Rusty Trifle?).      Next-left is a runout~ somewhat harder pitch.

Step (or fall?) across to the main face into a shallow alcove just left of a right-trending crack. Trend right up crack~ or up to top of alcove then exit right to crack~ and up to a ledge.     Next up shallow gully on right side of bulge.   . . Variation 2 (more interesting but not protected): Step left on ledge~ then up over left side of bulge.   Move left to base of arete with fins which forms left edge of upper Tower Wall.    Up the arete with fins~ perhaps with moves both strenuous and balancy (crux)   . . Variation 3: Climb a few feet on the face to right of arete up to overhang~ then escape left to join the arete.    Finish up a short slab.   warning: The rock around this sector has not been climbed much yet~ and much of the rock is still breakable and loose -- so the belayer and other people should stand far away from underneath the climber.,"Lead: normal NY style Trad rack.    The 2011 print guidebook and the Rakkup phone app (as of 2017) seem to imply that this route is reasonably protectable~ but a substantial percentage of climbers think it's more like PG-13.    Perhaps this route might be said to be reasonably protected if the leader ""does everything right""~ including:    - uses Variation 1~    - takes extra care to make sure one of the low pieces does not pull out after climb past it~    - makes at least one strenuous placement which does not seem necessary at the time but is the last chance for awhile~    - accepts that a lengthy less-difficult section in the middle has no protection~ and    - is prepared that while the tricky balancy sequence of the upper crux section may be 5.8 after you know it~ on sight it might feel more like 5.9 and need more finger endurance/strength just to hang on while working out each move.   Top-Rope: Likely easiest with a very long static line (at least 100 ft) - to reach tree set way back from top of cliff - also likely want to rappel or down-climb below the top 20 or 30 feet to set the carabiners lower~ so to avoid dragging / abrasion of the rope over the cliff top edge.    Reaching the top of the cliff: One simple (but not short) way is to hike left (WNW) past the base of sectors Three Bears and Daves Wall to the intersection of the Tower Wall tier trail with The Good Book access trail. Turn Right and follow The Good Book trail up a steep slope~ then after it gets gentle~ find a way off it right and upward toward the mini-summit view at the top of the Tower Wall cliff.",12

Higher the rock quality worsened~ but never to the point that we had to debate the value in continuing upward. Overall~ this route traveled through a lot of 5.6-5.8 difficulty loose terrain. It is significantly looser than the standard route for comparison and therefore I can't recommend it. Choss aficionados and seekers of the obscure may enjoy it.

Variations:  for the lowest part~ you can TR on or just to the left of the rib's arete - it wouldn't make a great lead.

There are two cruxes.  The first is just a bit off the deck at the 20 ft. mark and involves the temptation to lean into the tree to make the move easier.  Don't do it and keep it legit and 5.9+.  The second crux is up high at 3/4 height on the upper slab face and involves thin crimps and side pulls off good feet at a nice horizontal.  The climb ends at the big ledge shared by both the adjoining routes and climber finishes climbing to the top via the upper groove of the normal Coatimundi Crack.  I am quite sure this climb has been top roped over the many years but it does not appear in any guidebook I have checked.  I practiced the moves on TR and planned out the gear   placements then went back and led from ground up.  I gave it the R safety rating because of the small gear options at and above the first crux.,The protection is bomber but at the feet at both cruxes (good deep and stacked cams in solid horizontal cracks).  There is a deep but small RP#3 placement at the first crux to keep from hitting the ground.  Above the first crux there is a small run-out but on easier moves.

There were originally 4 bolts and then an anchor~ but the first bolt has been chopped.  This makes the climb a bit R rated as the second bolt (now the first bolt) is at least 6 metres from the ground and is not at a great spot for clipping.  There is~ however~ a small crack where you could stick in a nut about 4 metres from the start.  The crux is halfway up the climb at the (now) second bolt.     The original rating on this climb was a 6a but I disagree with the rating on this climb as I've climbed all the other 6a climbs at this crag and this one is much harder than those.  Definitely closer to 6c but not a 7a.  Potentially the original rating was based on the fact that this is a much shorter climb than the others.    Also~ a little safety hazard that you may or may not see~  There are a few tiny rusty nails that are hammered into the crack in a couple places.  Not sure what they are there for~ but if you can~ just take them out (update: September 2013~ I was able to get one out).  There are at least 3 for sure~ but they are pretty hard to get out with just your fingers... ,The first bolt has been chopped~ so the first bolt that is on the route is at about 6 metres up.  A bit R rated as this is a pretty good size fall if you screw up.      There is a crack were you could get in a nut though at about 4 metres up so that could make it a bit safer.      After the first bolt there are two more and then the anchors.      So~ a total of 3 draws are needed~ plus a small nut if you want that extra protection.,1

Rest of the pitch has moves ranging 6a-6b. station 2 is above the hump/roof towards right after climbing 20-25 ft past the crux section.     Pitch 3 (50ft/4+): Easy Traverse towards right with 5 bolts to clip. Go around the big block of rock to reach Station 3.   Pitch 4 (70 ft/6b+): Vertical+ Overhanging crack. Starts with a nice vertical hand crack(6a+/6b)for approx. 55ft. Slightly overhanging finger crack approx. 15 ft. Then top out with some high feet moves. Station 4 is in the shape of kitchen sink towards left. Probably the best pitch in the whole climb.   Pitch5 (60ft/6a+): 2-3 relatively harder/scary moves. High feet and knee bar can be used in these sections. There will a point where you may not find the last bolts~ climb towards left and not  towards right~ then you can see the bolts. Very firm tree on the top can be used to set up belay for the follower. Tree is on a near flat ground. One can belay very comfortably.,Route is completely and nicely bolted. Very firm tree and comfortable belay stand at the top of the climb i.e. end of 5th pitch.,1
